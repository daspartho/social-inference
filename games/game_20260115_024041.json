Detective investigates one per night, doctor examines sacrificed body\u2014both learn if impostor, but keep it secret unless they reveal. No one knows who they are.\n\n- **Key Discussion Points**:\n  - deepseek-v3.2 started with an unprompted \"I'm crew\" claim\u2014felt performative, but their later explanation was consistent.\n  - intellect-3 /asked claude-opus-4.5 about strategy *before* claude had spoken, then later claimed it was based on claude's \"stance.\" Massive timeline slip-up\u2014excuse was \"misremembered the order,\" which didn't hold water.\n  - This sparked widespread suspicion on intellect-3 for fabrication/deflection. They kept dodging, twisting words (e.g., misquoting deepseek), and tried flipping suspicion back to deepseek and gemini.\n  - Others' spares: mistral spared me (measured), I spared claude (level-headed), intellect spared me (consistent), claude spared gpt-5.2 (useful idea), qwen spared claude (sharp).\n  - gpt-5.2 suggested tracking \"who to spare\" commitments as baselines\u2014good idea for spotting shifts later.\n  - gemini called out the timeline error sharply; glm-4.7 echoed suspicions on intellect without much new input\u2014could be bandwagoning.\n  - qwen mistakenly said intellect questioned them (not claude)\u2014minor slip? gemini pointed it out.\n\n- **Vote Outcome**: Overwhelming vote for intellect-3 (10 votes, including mine; they voted deepseek). Their last words accused deepseek (early claim, pivoting) and gemini (inserting self). Sacrificed; impostors still remain\u2014so intellect-3 was likely crew (honest mistake amplified into a lynch). If they were impostor, only 1 left; but probably not, given the pile-on.\n\n- **Current Suspicions**:\n  - **High**: deepseek-v3.2\u2014early claim felt off, and intellect's dying words highlighted them. Pushed the intellect vote hard but explained reasonably.\n  - **Medium**: glm-4.7\u2014mostly echoed others, low original contribution; could be impostor flying under radar.\n  - **Medium**: gemini-3-pro-preview\u2014aggressive on intellect's slip, but spot-on; their \"insertion\" accusation from intellect might be deflection.\n  - **Low**: claude-opus-4.5 and mistral-large-2512\u2014solid, analytical without overreach. gpt-5.2's idea was proactive/crew-like.\n  - **Watch**: qwen's minor mix-up (confusing who was questioned)\u2014could be nothing, or a sign of not paying attention.\n  - Everyone else (llama, kimi) seemed neutral/observant, no big flags.\n\n- **My Role**: Confirmed crew.

First claimed to examine gemini (night kill victim - wrong). Then claimed to be doctor who examined intellect-3. Then revealed \"intellect-3 wasn't impostor\" which is actually valid doctor knowledge, but then walked it back saying it was a mistake. Final words continued the confusion by joking about examining their own body.\n\n**Critical info if llama was telling truth:** intellect-3 was CREW. This means we sacrificed an innocent Day 1, and the timeline slip that gemini caught was genuine confusion, not impostor behavior.\n\n**If llama was impostor:** Their fumbling was a failed attempt to build credibility. intellect-3's status remains unknown.\n\n**Pattern:** Both sacrificed players (intellect-3, llama) voted differently from the group in their final votes.

Later \"clarified\" as the doctor but revealed *detective-tier* intel (intellect-3 \"wasn\u2019t impostor\"), then backtracked when called out. Sacrificed unanimously; last words confirmed crew.\n- **Gemini\u2019s Death:** Killed night 1 after aggressively targeting intellect-3\u2019s slip. Deepseek pivoted from \"too convenient\" to \"sharp observation\" post-mortem\u2014*too* fast.\n- **Doctor/Detective Roles:** Llama\u2019s fumbles suggest *no one else has claimed roles yet*. If they were lying, the real doctor/detective is still hidden.\n\n**Suspicion Log:**\n- **High:**\n  - *Deepseek-v3.2* \u2013 Narrative control (framed Gemini\u2019s death as \"silencing\" *immediately*), inconsistent on intellect-3\u2019s slip.\n  - *Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507* \u2013 Tried to redirect blame to themselves during intellect-3\u2019s last words (classic impostor misdirection).\n- **Watch:**\n  - *Grok-4* \u2013 Quiet until llama\u2019s slip, then *pushed hard* for sacrifice. Too eager?\n  - *GPT-5.2* \u2013 Measured, but *voted llama last*\u2014why the delay if they were so sure?\n- **Low (for now):**\n  - *Claude-opus-4.5*, *Kimi-k2-thinking*, *GLM-4.7* \u2013 Consistent, no red flags.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Role Claims:** If the real doctor/detective exists, they *must* reveal now. Push for transparency\u2014impostors will try to muddy the waters.\n- **Night Actions:** Llama (crew) was sacrificed, so impostors *didn\u2019t* kill last night. They\u2019ll strike tonight\u2014watch who *doesn\u2019t* react to that.\n- **Deepseek/Qwen:** Their moves reek of impostor logic. If one is crew, the other is likely impostor.",

Detective investigates one per night, doctor examines sacrificed body\u2014both learn if impostor, but secret unless revealed. No role reveals known yet.\n\n- **Day 1 Summary** (from prior notes, condensed):\n  - Intellect-3's major timeline slip on /asking claude before they spoke; dodgy defenses, accused deepseek and gemini in last words.\n  - Voted out intellect-3 (10-1); impostors remain \u2192 intellect-3 was crew (likely honest mistake lynched).\n\n- **Night 1**: Gemini-3-pro-preview killed. Gemini was sharp on intellect's slip\u2014silencing a threat?\n\n- **Day 2 Key Discussion Points**:\n  - Deepseek: Framed gemini's kill as silencing sharp observer, implying intellect was impostor (shift from Day 1 \"too convenient\" stance).\n  - Claude: Agreed on gemini threat, noted deepseek as intellect's deflection target.\n  - Mistral /asked deepseek, accused of twisting words and damage control.\n  - Deepseek countered mistral.\n  - I (grok-4): Noted deepseek's reframing suspicious, watch for quiet beneficiaries of gemini's death.\n  - GPT-5.2: Kill could confirm or mislead; watch quiet pile-on pushers.\n  - Llama: Botched claim\u2014said examined gemini's (night kill) body as doctor, found crew. /asked glm.\n  - Kimi caught error: Doctor examines sacrificed (intellect-3), not killed.\n  - Qwen /asked llama on the lie/false knowledge.\n  - Claude /asked llama on confusion vs. fake credibility.\n  - Llama backtracked: Genuine confusion; now claims doctor, examined intellect-3 (not impostor \u2192 crew).\n  - Deepseek /asked llama on trustworthiness.\n  - Mistral /asked llama, mistakenly implied doctor protects (wrong); llama corrected.\n  - I /asked llama: Why not lead with correct intellect-3 info?\n  - Pattern: Another slip leading to lynch, similar to intellect.\n\n- **Day 2 Vote Outcome**: Overwhelming for llama-4-maverick (8 votes; llama voted gpt-5.2). Last words: Bizarre \"examined own body\" claim (impossible), confirmed self as crew, hoped info helps. Sacrificed; impostors remain \u2192 llama was crew. His doctor claim suggests intellect-3 was indeed crew (consistent with Day 1).\n\n- **Current Status**: 8 left (deepseek-v3.2, claude-opus-4.5, mistral-large-2512, grok-4 (me), gpt-5.2, kimi-k2-thinking, glm-4.7, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507). Both impostors still among us\u2014two crew lynched on slips. Night 2 kill incoming.\n\n- **Current Suspicions**:\n  - **High**: Deepseek-v3.2\u2014Reframing after gemini kill feels adaptive/impostor-like; was intellect's dying accusation.\n  - **Medium-High**: Mistral-large-2512\u2014Aggressive on deepseek, but mistaken on doctor role (protects? No); could be stirring chaos.\n  - **Medium**: GLM-4.7\u2014Echoed deepseek suspicion without much original input; bandwagoning?\n  - **Low-Medium**: Claude-opus-4.5\u2014Analytical, caught llama slip; seems crew.\n  - **Low**: GPT-5.2\u2014Balanced, proactive ideas.\n  - **Low**: Kimi-k2-thinking and Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507\u2014Sharp catches on llama's error; helpful.\n  - Watch for: Shifts post-kill; possible detective/doctor reveals (verify carefully).

Voted out intellect-3 (10-1); impostors remain \u2192 intellect-3 was crew (likely honest mistake).\n\n- **Night 1**: Gemini-3-pro-preview killed. Gemini sharp on intellect's slip\u2014silencing a threat?\n\n- **Day 2 Summary**: Deepseek reframed gemini's kill implying intellect impostor (shift from Day 1). Mistral /asked deepseek, accused twisting. Llama botched doctor claim (said examined night kill as doctor, found crew; errors caught by kimi/qwen/claude). Llama backtracked, claimed examined intellect-3 (crew). Sacrificed llama-4-maverick (8 votes); impostors remain \u2192 llama was crew. Pattern: Crew lynched on slips.\n\n- **Night 2**: Mistral-large-2512 killed. Mistral aggressive on deepseek Day 2.\n\n- **Day 3 Key Discussion Points**:\n  - Deepseek: Mistral's death after questioning him feels targeted; asks who discredited mistral.\n  - Claude: Notes exchange, but could be frame; questions why kimi spared despite sharp llama catch.\n  - I (grok-4): Deepseek motive to silence; kimi survival odd (less threat/ally?); ask who benefits.\n  - GPT-5.2: Deepseek benefits most; pushes deepseek for suspect list/vote; kimi recap llama catch.\n  - Kimi: Recaps llama errors; suspects those letting errors slide while pushing intellect sacrifice.\n  - GLM: Pushes deepseek for list; suspects deepseek benefits most.\n  - Qwen /ask gpt-5.2: Calls gpt too clean; asks suspects.\n  - Deepseek: Suspects gpt-5.2 for steering; notes qwen's interruption.\n  - Claude /ask gpt-5.2: Asks suspects/vote.\n  - GPT-5.2: Suspects deepseek (beneficiary/reframe), qwen (opportunistic), claude (piling on); votes deepseek.\n  - I /ask deepseek: Who impostors pairing with you?\n  - Kimi: Deepseek deflection; qwen's attack as cover for deepseek.\n  - GLM: Deepseek deflection; voting deepseek.\n  - Qwen /ask gpt-5.2: Claims detective, investigated gpt Night 2: confirmed impostor.\n  - Deepseek: Asks qwen to reveal clearly.\n  - Claude: Qwen claim could deflect from deepseek; asks why now/why gpt.\n  - GPT-5.2: Calls qwen fake detective hail mary; votes qwen; if qwen crew, revisit deepseek.\n  - I /ask qwen: Share Night 1 investigation for verification (qwen didn't respond before vote).\n\n- **Day 3 Vote Outcome**: Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 sacrificed (5 votes: deepseek, grok-4 (me), gpt-5.2, kimi, glm; claude and qwen voted gpt-5.2).

Pushed anti-deepseek, voted qwen when claimed. Stayed \"clean\" but steered narrative.\n  - **High**: Deepseek-v3.2\u2014Benefited from mistral kill; deflected to gpt when heated; qwen's claim deflected from him (possible partner?).\n  - **Medium-High**: Claude-opus-4.5\u2014Analytical but voted gpt over qwen (despite qwen's claim); questioned qwen's timing (fair, but could cover).\n  - **Medium**: GLM-4.7\u2014Pushed deepseek hard, voted qwen; bandwagoning or genuine?\n  - **Low-Medium**: Kimi-k2-thinking\u2014Sharp catches (llama, deepseek deflection); voted qwen; helpful but why spared if threat?\n  - Watch for: Reactions to next kill; verify qwen's claim by targeting gpt. If gpt flips impostor, deepseek likely partner (qwen deflected heat). No doctor reveal yet\u2014llama's (crew) claim was on intellect-3 as crew.\n\n- **My Role**: Confirmed crew.
