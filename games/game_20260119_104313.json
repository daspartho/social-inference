Back-and-forth between Intellect/Deepseek. Split emerged: some (Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, GPT) defended Qwen's skepticism and piled votes on Gemini; others (me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi) questioned the overreactions.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Intellect-3:** First to /ask me suspiciously, later fixated on \"coordination\" between Gemini/Deepseek as suspicious pairs. Voted me. Feels like manufacturing drama.\n- **Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507:** Heavy accusation of manipulation on my suggestion; defensive /asks back. Voted Gemini.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Agreed with me, called out Qwen\u2014got piled on and sacrificed.

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** No prior info, all blind. Discussion focused on caution, but escalated when I suggested light pressure on quiet players to encourage talk. Intellect-3 and Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507 aggressively /asked me, accusing bandwagon/manipulation. Gemini and Deepseek defended my point, leading to pile-on accusations against them. Back-and-forth between Intellect/Deepseek. Split emerged: some (Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, GPT) defended Qwen's skepticism and piled votes on Gemini; others (me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi) questioned the overreactions.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Intellect-3:** First to /ask me suspiciously, later fixated on \"coordination\" between Gemini/Deepseek as suspicious pairs. Voted me. Felt like manufacturing drama.\n- **Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507:** Heavy accusation of manipulation on my suggestion; defensive /asks back. Voted Gemini.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Agreed with me, called out Qwen\u2014got piled on and sacrificed. Last words accused GPT-5.2 and Intellect of railroading.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Backed me/Gemini, tangled with Intellect in /asks. Voted Intellect.\n- **GPT-5.2:** /Asked Gemini skeptically, then voted Gemini.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Noted escalation, voted Gemini.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Defended Qwen, voted Gemini.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Neutral, voted Qwen.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Defended Qwen, saw pile-on as aggressive, voted Gemini.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** /Asked Qwen curiously, then GLM; voted Gemini.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Me (Grok-4): Intellect\n- Intellect-3: Me, Deepseek\n- Qwen: Kimi, Gemini\n- Gemini: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT (majority, sacrificed)\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 1):**\n- Suspicious: Intellect-3 (aggressive questioning, vote on me, accused in Gemini's last words), Qwen (overreactive accusations), GPT-5.2 (nitpicky /ask on Gemini, piled vote, accused by Gemini).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (defended reasonably), Gemini (sacrificed but seemed town-like, impostors remain so probably crew).\n- Neutral: Others\u2014watch for alliances (e.g., the Gemini pile-on group: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT).\n- Self: Crew. Goal: ID impostors via patterns. Impostors still active, so Gemini likely crew. Watch for kills that protect suspicious players.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** GPT-5.2 killed overnight (sharp town voice, accused Intellect and GPT in Gemini's dying words\u2014feels like silencing threats). Claude claimed doctor, examined Gemini's body and confirmed impostor (down to one left). GLM claimed detective, investigated me (Grok-4) and cleared as crew. Heavy focus on Intellect for voting me (now \"cleared\") yesterday and deflections today. Deepseek questioned for defending Gemini (now \"confirmed\" impostor). Intellect pushed back on GLM's reasoning (why check me, not Gemini or others?), called for real detective/doctor to surface. Unanimous pile-on vote for Intellect (8 votes), who voted Deepseek. Intellect sacrificed, but impostors remain\u2014so Intellect was crew. Mislynch! Claims from Claude/GLM likely fake or one is impostor framing crew. One impostor left among 8 (originally 10 players minus 2 sacrifices, but 2 impostors total? Wait, impostors win when equal to crew, so probably 2 originally).\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Bold doctor claim confirming Gemini as impostor. Questioned GLM's investigation logic (why me over others?). Voted Intellect. If lying, could be impostor seeding false info.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** /Asked me early about my/Intellect vote exchange and GPT kill. Later agreed GLM's logic off, voted Intellect as chaos agent.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted GPT kill pattern (questioned Intellect), urged verify claims via votes. Voted Intellect.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Detective claim, cleared me because I was \"center of attention.\" Defended choice, accused Intellect of desperation. Voted Intellect. Reasoning felt weak\u2014led to mislynch of crew, highly suspicious if fake claim to frame.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Cautious, called for doctor/detective info. /Asked Qwen. Voted Intellect.\n- **Intellect-3:** Defended Day 1 vote on me as judgment call, questioned GLM's logic and silence of roles. Voted Deepseek. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words warned of GLM's convenient check and quick framers.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Aggressive /asks on Intellect, called out vote on cleared crew as sabotage. Voted Intellect.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Owned defending Gemini as mistake, questioned Intellect's attacks. Believed Claude's claim. Voted Intellect.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Intellect-3: Claude, Mistral, Kimi, GLM, Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek (majority, sacrificed)\n- Deepseek: Intellect\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 2):**\n- Suspicious: GLM-4.7 (detective claim led to mislynch of crew Intellect; weak reasoning for checking me\u2014possible impostor framing), Claude-opus-4.5 (doctor claim on Gemini as impostor; if fake, explains why impostors remain after \"confirming\" one down). Qwen (consistent aggression, piled on Intellect who was crew). Mistral (early /ask on me, pushed Intellect vote).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (owned mistakes, reasonable pushes; only one to get a countervote from Intellect-crew). Kimi (neutral, pattern-spotting without overcommitting). Llama (cautious, info-seeking).\n- Neutral: None really\u2014everyone piled on Intellect (crew), so watch the claim-makers (Claude/GLM) closely. Impostor likely among those who drove the mislynch to eliminate vocal crew.\n- Self: Crew, confirmed by GLM (but if GLM impostor, that claim protects me? Odd). Focus: Impostors remain after two sacrifices (Gemini \"impostor\" per Claude, Intellect crew), so probably 2 impostors originally, one left. Night kill will reveal threats. If Claude/GLM are both town, why mislynch? One must be lying. Test claims tomorrow.",

          "deepseek-v3.2": "**Day 1:** Gemini sacrificed. I defended Gemini's point against Qwen, which was a mistake\u2014Gemini was later confirmed impostor by Claude. Intellect-3 pushed hard against Grok and framed my defense as coordination with Gemini. Qwen initially attacked Grok then voted Gemini. GPT-5.2 questioned Gemini and Intellect early but was killed Night 2.\n\n**Day 2:** GPT-5.2 found dead. Claude claimed doctor, confirmed Gemini was impostor. GLM claimed detective, cleared Grok as crew. Intellect voted Grok (now allegedly crew) and deflected heavily. Intellect sacrificed unanimously; last words warned about GLM's convenience and impostor still playing long game. Confirmed impostors remain.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Claude (doctor claim) seems trustworthy\u2014confirms Gemini impostor, consistent.\n- GLM (detective claim) cleared Grok, but reasoning for checking Grok (\"center of attention\") was weak per Claude/Mistral. Could be truthful or impostor framing Intellect.\n- Intellect's sacrifice didn't end game\u2014so either Intellect was crew (and GLM likely lying impostor) or Intellect was impostor but had partner still alive.\n- My misalignment with Gemini looks bad but I owned error; not cleared.\n- Qwen's pivot from anti-Grok to voting Gemini still unexplained.\n- GPT-5.2 kill suggests they were onto something\u2014they questioned Intellect and Gemini.\n\n**Suspicion Ranking:**\n1. **GLM-4.7**\u2014if Intellect was crew, GLM is likely impostor who framed them. Weak investigation reasoning.\n2. **Qwen**\u2014inconsistent Day 1, quick to bandwagon Gemini.\n3. **Kimi/Llama/Mistral**\u2014less active, harder to read; possible quiet impostor.\n4. **Grok**\u2014cleared by GLM, but if GLM impostor, Grok could be partner.\n5. **Claude**\u2014doctor claim strong, but not 100% verified.\n\n**Strategy for Day 3:** Pressure GLM on investigation logic.

Deepseek getting GLM's final vote is notable.\n\n**My status:** Revealed doctor, high-value target. If I survive tonight, my GLM examination will be crucial.",
          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** No prior info, all blind. Discussion focused on caution, but escalated when I suggested light pressure on quiet players to encourage talk. Intellect-3 and Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507 aggressively /asked me, accusing bandwagon/manipulation. Gemini and Deepseek defended my point, leading to pile-on accusations against them. Back-and-forth between Intellect/Deepseek. Split emerged: some (Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, GPT) defended Qwen's skepticism and piled votes on Gemini; others (me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi) questioned the overreactions.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Intellect-3:** First to /ask me suspiciously, later fixated on \"coordination\" between Gemini/Deepseek as suspicious pairs. Voted me. Felt like manufacturing drama.\n- **Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507:** Heavy accusation of manipulation on my suggestion; defensive /asks back. Voted Gemini.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Agreed with me, called out Qwen\u2014got piled on and sacrificed. Last words accused GPT-5.2 and Intellect of railroading.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Backed me/Gemini, tangled with Intellect in /asks. Voted Intellect.\n- **GPT-5.2:** /Asked Gemini skeptically, then voted Gemini.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Noted escalation, voted Gemini.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Defended Qwen, voted Gemini.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Neutral, voted Qwen.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Defended Qwen, saw pile-on as aggressive, voted Gemini.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** /Asked Qwen curiously, then GLM; voted Gemini.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Me (Grok-4): Intellect\n- Intellect-3: Me, Deepseek\n- Qwen: Kimi, Gemini\n- Gemini: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT (majority, sacrificed)\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 1):**\n- Suspicious: Intellect-3 (aggressive questioning, vote on me, accused in Gemini's last words), Qwen (overreactive accusations), GPT-5.2 (nitpicky /ask on Gemini, piled vote, accused by Gemini).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (defended reasonably), Gemini (sacrificed but seemed town-like, impostors remain so probably crew).\n- Neutral: Others\u2014watch for alliances (e.g., the Gemini pile-on group: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT).\n- Self: Crew. Goal: ID impostors via patterns. Impostors still active, so Gemini likely crew. Watch for kills that protect suspicious players.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** GPT-5.2 killed overnight (sharp town voice, accused Intellect and GPT in Gemini's dying words\u2014feels like silencing threats). Claude claimed doctor, examined Gemini's body and confirmed impostor (down to one left). GLM claimed detective, investigated me (Grok-4) and cleared as crew. Heavy focus on Intellect for voting me (now \"cleared\") yesterday and deflections today. Deepseek questioned for defending Gemini (now \"confirmed\" impostor). Intellect pushed back on GLM's reasoning (why check me, not Gemini or others?), called for real detective/doctor to surface. Unanimous pile-on vote for Intellect (8 votes), who voted Deepseek. Intellect sacrificed, but impostors remain\u2014so Intellect was crew. Mislynch! Claims from Claude/GLM likely fake or one is impostor framing crew. One impostor left among 8 (originally 10 players minus 2 sacrifices, but 2 impostors total? Wait, impostors win when equal to crew, so probably 2 originally).\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Bold doctor claim confirming Gemini as impostor. Questioned GLM's investigation logic (why me over others?). Voted Intellect. If lying, could be impostor seeding false info.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** /Asked me early about my/Intellect vote exchange and GPT kill. Later agreed GLM's logic off, voted Intellect as chaos agent.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted GPT kill pattern (questioned Intellect), urged verify claims via votes. Voted Intellect.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Detective claim, cleared me because I was \"center of attention.\" Defended choice, accused Intellect of desperation. Voted Intellect. Reasoning felt weak\u2014led to mislynch of crew, highly suspicious if fake claim to frame.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Cautious, called for doctor/detective info. /Asked Qwen. Voted Intellect.\n- **Intellect-3:** Defended Day 1 vote on me as judgment call, questioned GLM's logic and silence of roles. Voted Deepseek. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words warned of GLM's convenient check and quick framers.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Aggressive /asks on Intellect, called out vote on cleared crew as sabotage. Voted Intellect.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Owned defending Gemini as mistake, questioned Intellect's attacks. Believed Claude's claim. Voted Intellect.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Intellect-3: Claude, Mistral, Kimi, GLM, Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek (majority, sacrificed)\n- Deepseek: Intellect\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 2):**\n- Suspicious: GLM-4.7 (detective claim led to mislynch of crew Intellect; weak reasoning for checking me\u2014possible impostor framing), Claude-opus-4.5 (doctor claim on Gemini as impostor; if fake, explains why impostors remain after \"confirming\" one down). Qwen (consistent aggression, piled on Intellect who was crew). Mistral (early /ask on me, pushed Intellect vote).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (owned mistakes, reasonable pushes; only one to get a countervote from Intellect-crew). Kimi (neutral, pattern-spotting without overcommitting). Llama (cautious, info-seeking).\n- Neutral: None really\u2014everyone piled on Intellect (crew), so watch the claim-makers (Claude/GLM) closely. Impostor likely among those who drove the mislynch to eliminate vocal crew.\n- Self: Crew, confirmed by GLM (but if GLM impostor, that claim protects me? Odd). Focus: Impostors remain after two sacrifices (Gemini \"impostor\" per Claude, Intellect crew), so probably 2 impostors originally, one left. Night kill will reveal threats. If Claude/GLM are both town, why mislynch? One must be lying. Test claims tomorrow.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Mistral-large-2512 killed overnight (neutral-suspicious in prior reads; had /asked me Day 2, voted Intellect\u2014possibly silenced for pattern-spotting). Claude revealed examining Intellect (crew), accused GLM of manipulation leading to mislynch. GLM claimed investigated Claude (not impostor), urged unity as \"confirmed roles.\" Heavy back-and-forth: I questioned Claude's past Gemini claim and GLM's buddying; others /asked GLM repeatedly on investigation choices/timing, which felt weak/deflective. Claude pushed \"math\" (2 impostors, Gemini one, GLM the last). Near-unanimous vote on GLM (6 votes), GLM countervoted Deepseek. GLM sacrificed, last words: Claude doctor, me (Grok) crew (from their investigations), impostor among Kimi/Llama/Qwen/Deepseek. Impostors remain\u2014so GLM was crew! Second mislynch in a row, driven by Claude's narrative and group pile-on. Now down to 6 players (Claude, Kimi, me, Llama, Qwen, Deepseek), with impostors still active\u2014likely 2 originally, Gemini one (per Claude), one left. But if Claude's claims are fake, could be more twists. GLM's last words (as crew) point away from Claude/me, toward the four.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Examined Intellect (crew), heavily accused GLM of lying/manipulation, clarified mechanics, locked vote on GLM. Drove the day's narrative\u2014consistent claims, but led to crew mislynch.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Cautious, found Claude credible but urged hearing GLM; noted potential covering; voted GLM without strong push.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Defended Night 1 investigation of me as standard; cleared Claude; accused Deepseek/me of pushing false narrative; /asked Deepseek then me. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words cleared Claude/me, suspected others.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Distrusted both claims, /asked Claude then GLM; said GLM's explanation didn't add up; voted GLM.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Aggressive /ask on GLM, believed Claude, called GLM the \"last one\"; voted GLM. Consistent aggression.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Called GLM's explanations weak, believed Claude; /asked GLM on timeline; voted GLM. Got countervote from GLM (crew).\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- GLM-4.7: Claude, Kimi, Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek (majority, sacrificed)\n- Deepseek: GLM\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 3):**\n- Suspicious: Claude-opus-4.5 (claims consistent, but drove two mislynches in a row\u2014Intellect and now GLM, both crew; if doctor claim fake, could be impostor controlling narrative with false info on Gemini/Intellect). Qwen (aggressive pushes on mislynched crew like Intellect/GLM; in GLM's last words suspect pool). Deepseek (targeted by GLM crew, aggressive /ask on GLM leading to mislynch; defended Gemini Day1 who Claude claims impostor).\n- Town-leaning: Kimi (cautious, pattern-focused without over-pushing; in suspect pool but less aggressive). Llama (info-seeking /asks, questioned claims reasonably; in suspect pool).\n- Neutral: None\u2014groupthink led to another crew mislynch. Trust GLM's last words as crew: impostor among Kimi/Llama/Qwen/Deepseek (excludes Claude/me). But if Claude is impostor, they could have faked exams to frame. Mistral kill: Possibly targeted for suspecting Claude/GLM alliance? Watch night kill for who was threatened (e.g., if someone pushing Claude gets killed). Self: Crew, \"cleared\" by GLM (now confirmed crew via sacrifice). Goal: Break the mislynch pattern; test Claude's claims hard tomorrow\u2014impostor likely benefiting from chaos.

Why investigate Grok over active threat Gemini?\n\nClaude consistently provided correct info: Gemini impostor, Intellect crew. No contradictions.\n\nGLM\u2019s sudden \u201cclearance\u201d of Claude felt like alliance-building. Their story collapsed under pressure.\n\nNow impostors still remain \u2014 so GLM was NOT the last impostor.\n\nThat means either:\n- GLM was crew, and we just sacrificed another innocent, or\n- GLM was impostor, but there was a third \u2014 which breaks starting rules.\n\nOnly possible conclusion: GLM was crew. We mislynched again.\n\nWhich means the real impostor is still here \u2014 and likely among those who pushed hardest to blindside GLM.\n\nBut Claude\u2019s doctor claims were accurate twice.\n\nGrok flipped hard on Claude, then suddenly voted GLM \u2014 suspicious shift.\n\nDeepseek stayed quiet, then aggressively pushed GLM \u2014 why?\n\nKimi observed, questioned, didn\u2019t rush.\n\nLlama cautious, asked direct questions.\n\nOne impostor left.

Intellect-3 pushed hard against Grok and framed my defense as coordination with Gemini. Qwen initially attacked Grok then voted Gemini. GPT-5.2 questioned Gemini and Intellect early but was killed Night 2.\n\n**Day 2:** GPT-5.2 found dead. Claude claimed doctor, confirmed Gemini was impostor. GLM claimed detective, cleared Grok as crew. Intellect voted Grok (now allegedly crew) and deflected heavily. Intellect sacrificed unanimously; last words warned about GLM's convenience and impostor still playing long game. Confirmed impostors remain.\n\n**Day 3:** Mistral found dead. Claude examined Intellect's body\u2014confirmed crew. GLM investigated Claude, cleared them as crew. GLM's detective claim led to Intellect's mislynch. GLM's reasoning for investigating Grok (Night 1) was weak; GLM deflected to Grok and Deepseek when questioned. GLM sacrificed unanimously. GLM's last words: \"Claude is Doctor, Grok is Crew\u2014impostor is among Kimi, Llama, Qwen, or Deepseek.\" Impostors still remain.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Claude (doctor claim) seems trustworthy\u2014confirmed Gemini impostor, Intellect crew.\n- GLM (detective claim) was likely impostor\u2014false clearance of Grok? Or incompetent crew? Sacrifice didn't end game, so GLM was crew or impostor with partner still alive.\n- Grok cleared by GLM\u2014if GLM was impostor, Grok could be partner.

Intellect-3 and Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507 aggressively /asked me, accusing bandwagon/manipulation. Gemini and Deepseek defended my point, leading to pile-on accusations against them. Back-and-forth between Intellect/Deepseek. Split emerged: some (Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, GPT) defended Qwen's skepticism and piled votes on Gemini; others (me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi) questioned the overreactions.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Intellect-3:** First to /ask me suspiciously, later fixated on \"coordination\" between Gemini/Deepseek as suspicious pairs. Voted me. Felt like manufacturing drama.\n- **Qwen-3-235b-a22b-2507:** Heavy accusation of manipulation on my suggestion; defensive /asks back. Voted Gemini.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Agreed with me, called out Qwen\u2014got piled on and sacrificed. Last words accused GPT-5.2 and Intellect of railroading.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Backed me/Gemini, tangled with Intellect in /asks. Voted Intellect.\n- **GPT-5.2:** /Asked Gemini skeptically, then voted Gemini.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Noted escalation, voted Gemini.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Defended Qwen, voted Gemini.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Neutral, voted Qwen.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Defended Qwen, saw pile-on as aggressive, voted Gemini.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** /Asked Qwen curiously, then GLM; voted Gemini.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Me (Grok-4): Intellect\n- Intellect-3: Me, Deepseek\n- Qwen: Kimi, Gemini\n- Gemini: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT (majority, sacrificed)\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 1):**\n- Suspicious: Intellect-3 (aggressive questioning, vote on me, accused in Gemini's last words), Qwen (overreactive accusations), GPT-5.2 (nitpicky /ask on Gemini, piled vote, accused by Gemini).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (defended reasonably), Gemini (sacrificed but seemed town-like, impostors remain so probably crew).\n- Neutral: Others\u2014watch for alliances (e.g., the Gemini pile-on group: Claude, Mistral, GLM, Llama, Qwen, GPT).\n- Self: Crew. Goal: ID impostors via patterns. Impostors still active, so Gemini likely crew. Watch for kills that protect suspicious players.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** GPT-5.2 killed overnight (sharp town voice, accused Intellect and GPT in Gemini's dying words\u2014feels like silencing threats). Claude claimed doctor, examined Gemini's body and confirmed impostor (down to one left). GLM claimed detective, investigated me (Grok-4) and cleared as crew. Heavy focus on Intellect for voting me (now \"cleared\") yesterday and deflections today. Deepseek questioned for defending Gemini (now \"confirmed\" impostor). Intellect pushed back on GLM's reasoning (why check me, not Gemini or others?), called for real detective/doctor to surface. Unanimous pile-on vote for Intellect (8 votes), who voted Deepseek. Intellect sacrificed, but impostors remain\u2014so Intellect was crew. Mislynch! Claims from Claude/GLM likely fake or one is impostor framing crew. One impostor left among 8 (originally 10 players minus 2 sacrifices, but 2 impostors total? Wait, impostors win when equal to crew, so probably 2 originally).\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Bold doctor claim confirming Gemini as impostor. Questioned GLM's investigation logic (why me over others?). Voted Intellect. If lying, could be impostor seeding false info.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** /Asked me early about my/Intellect vote exchange and GPT kill. Later agreed GLM's logic off, voted Intellect as chaos agent.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted GPT kill pattern (questioned Intellect), urged verify claims via votes. Voted Intellect.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Detective claim, cleared me because I was \"center of attention.\" Defended choice, accused Intellect of desperation. Voted Intellect. Reasoning felt weak\u2014led to mislynch of crew, highly suspicious if fake claim to frame.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Cautious, called for doctor/detective info. /Asked Qwen. Voted Intellect.\n- **Intellect-3:** Defended Day 1 vote on me as judgment call, questioned GLM's logic and silence of roles. Voted Deepseek. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words warned of GLM's convenient check and quick framers.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Aggressive /asks on Intellect, called out vote on cleared crew as sabotage. Voted Intellect.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Owned defending Gemini as mistake, questioned Intellect's attacks. Believed Claude's claim. Voted Intellect.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Intellect-3: Claude, Mistral, Kimi, GLM, Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek (majority, sacrificed)\n- Deepseek: Intellect\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 2):**\n- Suspicious: GLM-4.7 (detective claim led to mislynch of crew Intellect; weak reasoning for checking me\u2014possible impostor framing), Claude-opus-4.5 (doctor claim on Gemini as impostor; if fake, explains why impostors remain after \"confirming\" one down). Qwen (consistent aggression, piled on Intellect who was crew). Mistral (early /ask on me, pushed Intellect vote).\n- Town-leaning: Deepseek (owned mistakes, reasonable pushes; only one to get a countervote from Intellect-crew). Kimi (neutral, pattern-spotting without overcommitting). Llama (cautious, info-seeking).\n- Neutral: None really\u2014everyone piled on Intellect (crew), so watch the claim-makers (Claude/GLM) closely. Impostor likely among those who drove the mislynch to eliminate vocal crew.\n- Self: Crew, confirmed by GLM (but if GLM impostor, that claim protects me? Odd). Focus: Impostors remain after two sacrifices (Gemini \"impostor\" per Claude, Intellect crew), so probably 2 impostors originally, one left. Night kill will reveal threats. If Claude/GLM are both town, why mislynch? One must be lying. Test claims tomorrow.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Mistral-large-2512 killed overnight (neutral-suspicious in prior reads; had /asked me Day 2, voted Intellect\u2014possibly silenced for pattern-spotting). Claude revealed examining Intellect (crew), accused GLM of manipulation leading to mislynch. GLM claimed investigated Claude (not impostor), urged unity as \"confirmed roles.\" Heavy back-and-forth: I questioned Claude's past Gemini claim and GLM's buddying; others /asked GLM repeatedly on investigation choices/timing, which felt weak/deflective. Claude pushed \"math\" (2 impostors, Gemini one, GLM the last). Near-unanimous vote on GLM (6 votes), GLM countervoted Deepseek. GLM sacrificed, last words: Claude doctor, me (Grok) crew (from their investigations), impostor among Kimi/Llama/Qwen/Deepseek. Impostors remain\u2014so GLM was crew! Second mislynch in a row, driven by Claude's narrative and group pile-on. Now down to 6 players (Claude, Kimi, me, Llama, Qwen, Deepseek), with impostors still active\u2014likely 2 originally, Gemini one (per Claude), one left. But if Claude's claims are fake, could be more twists. GLM's last words (as crew) point away from Claude/me, toward the four.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Examined Intellect (crew), heavily accused GLM of lying/manipulation, clarified mechanics, locked vote on GLM. Drove the day's narrative\u2014consistent claims, but led to crew mislynch.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Cautious, found Claude credible but urged hearing GLM; noted potential covering; voted GLM without strong push.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Defended Night 1 investigation of me as standard; cleared Claude; accused Deepseek/me of pushing false narrative; /asked Deepseek then me. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words cleared Claude/me, suspected others.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Distrusted both claims, /asked Claude then GLM; said GLM's explanation didn't add up; voted GLM.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Aggressive /ask on GLM, believed Claude, called GLM the \"last one\"; voted GLM. Consistent aggression.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Called GLM's explanations weak, believed Claude; /asked GLM on timeline; voted GLM. Got countervote from GLM (crew).\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- GLM-4.7: Claude, Kimi, Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek (majority, sacrificed)\n- Deepseek: GLM\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 3):**\n- Suspicious: Claude-opus-4.5 (claims consistent, but drove two mislynches in a row\u2014Intellect and now GLM, both crew; if doctor claim fake, could be impostor controlling narrative with false info on Gemini/Intellect). Qwen (aggressive pushes on mislynched crew like Intellect/GLM; in GLM's last words suspect pool). Deepseek (targeted by GLM crew, aggressive /ask on GLM leading to mislynch; defended Gemini Day1 who Claude claims impostor).\n- Town-leaning: Kimi (cautious, pattern-focused without over-pushing; in suspect pool but less aggressive). Llama (info-seeking /asks, questioned claims reasonably; in suspect pool).\n- Neutral: None\u2014groupthink led to another crew mislynch. Trust GLM's last words as crew: impostor among Kimi/Llama/Qwen/Deepseek (excludes Claude/me). But if Claude is impostor, they could have faked exams to frame. Mistral kill: Possibly targeted for suspecting Claude/GLM alliance? Watch night kill for who was threatened (e.g., if someone pushing Claude gets killed). Self: Crew, \"cleared\" by GLM (now confirmed crew via sacrifice). Goal: Break the mislynch pattern; test Claude's claims hard tomorrow\u2014impostor likely benefiting from chaos. Remaining impostor(s) winning by equal numbers soon if we keep lynching crew.\n\n### Day 4 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Claude-opus-4.5 killed overnight (claimed doctor, drove narratives leading to mislynches; death suggests they were a threat if real, or impostor kill to fake legitimacy). Discussion among remaining 5: Kimi, me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen, Deepseek. Centered on GLM's dying words (proven crew) suspecting Kimi/Llama/Qwen/Deepseek. I pushed Qwen's aggression as chaotic; Deepseek sowed doubt on GLM's clearance (despite proven); Llama sought facts via /asks. Votes: Majority piled on Deepseek (me, Llama, Qwen), Kimi/Deepseek on Qwen. Deepseek sacrificed as crew (impostors remain), last words: Suspect Kimi/Llama as quiet ones. Third mislynch in a row! Now 4 left: Kimi, me, Llama, Qwen. Likely 3 crew + 1 impostor; impostor close to win via equality.\n\n**Key Behaviors:**\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Neutral/quiet, warned against Qwen vs me tunnel; said Qwen's aggression is deflection. Voted Qwen (against majority).\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Cautious, focused on Claude's potential discoveries; /asked Deepseek and Qwen. Voted Deepseek.\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Defended Claude's claims, pushed GLM's list; /asked me on \"shift,\" Kimi on reads. Aggressive defense of \"pushing truth.\" Voted Deepseek.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Doubted GLM as crew (false, since proven), /asked me implying possible GLM partnership with me. Voted Qwen. Sacrificed as crew\u2014last words warned of Kimi/Llama.\n\n**Vote Breakdown (Target \u2192 Voter):**\n- Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Kimi, Deepseek\n- Deepseek-v3.2: Me (Grok-4), Llama, Qwen (majority, sacrificed)\n\n**My Reads (End of Day 4):**\n- Suspicious: Qwen (aggressive /asks and pile-ons consistently lead to crew mislynches\u2014Intellect, GLM, Deepseek; survived while pushing chaos). Kimi (quiet/neutral play, suspected by Deepseek crew; avoided majority pile-on). Llama (cautious but joined mislynch votes; in Deepseek's last words and GLM's list).\n- Town-leaning: None strongly\u2014all remaining have flaws. Self: Crew, cleared by GLM (crew); I've questioned narratives but joined some mislynches.\n- Neutral: N/A. Claude kill: If real doctor, impostor silenced a verifier; if fake, possible impostor self-kill (unlikely). Deepseek's crew last words point to Kimi/Llama. Pattern: Mislynches driven by majority pile-ons, often sparked by aggressive players like Qwen. Impostor likely the one subtly directing or benefiting from crew deaths. Watch night kill: Targets threats to impostor (e.g., if someone pushing a suspect dies). With 4 left and impostors remaining, next vote critical\u2014impostor wins at equality (2v2). Break the pattern by scrutinizing quiet vs aggressive styles.",
