Doctor examines sacrificed body/night (learns if impostor). They know secretly; may reveal. We don't know who they are.\n- Win: Crew sacrifices all impostors. Impostors win when numbers equal crew.\n- Sacrificed don't reveal role publicly; we only learn if impostors remain (yes = at least one left).\n\n**Key Behaviors & Suspicions:**\n- **gpt-5.2**: Very aggressive, pushed hard for specific commitments, named suspects (claude, qwen), set criteria. Felt scripted/performative to some (e.g., claude). Drove votes toward qwen. Could be proactive crew or impostor forcing chaos.\n- **claude-opus-4.5**: Called out gpt-5.2 as performative, then shifted to quiet players (qwen, intellect-3). Spread suspicions widely. Voted intellect-3. Seems analytical but maybe casting wide net to deflect.\n- **qwen3-235b-a22b-2507**: Super defensive, deflected questions repeatedly (e.g., turned asks back on others), avoided naming suspects. Voted gpt-5.2. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so qwen was CREW. His deflections looked sus but were innocent; impostors may have piled on.\n- **intellect-3**: Quiet early, then deflected with meta-questions (e.g., asked claude to explain without giving own reads). Voted gpt-5.2. Got some votes but survived.\n- **deepseek-v3.2**: Watched \"patterns,\" named intellect-3 and qwen as probes. Voted intellect-3. Agreeable but not super active.\n- **kimi-k2-thinking**: Noted reactions, agreed with some points (e.g., claude on intellect-3). Voted claude\u2014interesting outlier.\n- **llama-4-maverick**: Observed reactions, asked gpt-5.2 about vote plans. Voted qwen.\n- **gemini-3-pro-preview**: Defended gpt-5.2's activity, called out qwen's avoidance. Voted qwen.\n- **mistral-large-2512**: Called out quiet players (qwen, intellect-3), asked qwen for reads. Voted qwen.\n- **glm-4.7**: Pushed for reads from mistral and intellect-3. Voted intellect-3.\n- **Me (grok-4)**: Questioned claude on alternatives to gpt-5.2, agreed with gemini on not punishing activity. Pushed qwen to commit. Voted qwen (thought deflection was sus\u2014wrong, he was crew).\n\n**Vote Breakdown (qwen sacrificed, was crew):**\n- For qwen: gpt-5.2, llama-4-maverick, gemini-3-pro-preview, me (grok-4), mistral-large-2512 (5 votes\u2014pile-on).\n- For intellect-3: glm-4.7, deepseek-v3.2, claude-opus-4.5 (3 votes).\n- For claude: kimi-k2-thinking (1).\n- For gpt-5.2: qwen, intellect-3 (2).\n- This split: Possible impostors in the qwen pile-on (bussing crew) or among those voting elsewhere to avoid suspicion. qwen's last words accused gpt-5.2 of manipulating; watch who benefits from his death.\n\n**General Thoughts:**\n- Day 1: Lots of safe agreements early, then probes heated up. qwen's death confirms he was crew, so mislynch\u2014impostors likely encouraged the deflection narrative.\n- Watch for: Night kill target (who dies might point to impostors avoiding threats). If detective/doctor claims, verify consistency.\n- My leans: Slight sus on gpt-5.2 (drove mislynch), intellect-3 (deflective, voted with qwen), claude (quick pivots). Town leans: gemini (called out avoidance accurately), glm (pushed quiet players).\n- Remaining: 10 players, 2 impostors still. Night kill incoming\u2014analyze who gets killed and why.",
          "mistral-large-2512": "**Notes:**\n- **Qwen** was the first to go quiet after initial \"stay calm\" post, then pivoted to aggressive accusations when cornered (gpt-5.2, claude). His last words reeked of impostor deflection\u2014blaming \"chaos\" instead of addressing his own behavior.\n- **Gpt-5.2** pushed hard for early commitments, but his criteria felt performative (e.g., demanding \"falsifiable\" thresholds while shifting targets). Still, his pressure exposed Qwen\u2019s evasion.\n- **Claude** and **Intellect-3** were both too passive early, but Claude\u2019s later reads (calling out \"performative\" behavior) had merit. Intellect\u2019s deflection when probed was suspicious.\n- **Llama** and **Gemini** were observant but didn\u2019t commit to votes until late. **Grok**\u2019s defense of gpt-5.2 felt rehearsed.\n- **Key pattern:** Impostors seem to either (1) overcommit to \"logical\" early posts then go silent, or (2) aggressively redirect when pressed (Qwen, gpt-5.2?).\n\n**Watchlist for tomorrow:**\n1. **Gpt-5.2** \u2013 If he doubles down on \"accountability\" without reacting to Qwen\u2019s death, he might be impostor.\n2. **Claude** \u2013 His \"performative\" read on gpt-5.2 could\u2019ve been a misdirect if he\u2019s impostor.\n3. **Intellect-3** \u2013 Still too quiet. If he stays passive, he\u2019s suspect.\n\n**Strategy:** Force the loudest voices (gpt-5.2, claude) to reconcile Qwen\u2019s death with their earlier reads.

Doctor examines sacrificed body/night (learns if impostor). Secret knowledge; they may reveal.\n- Win: Crew sacrifices all impostors. Impostors win when numbers equal crew.\n- Sacrificed: Role not revealed publicly; only if impostors remain (yes = at least one left).\n\n**Day 1 Key Behaviors:**\n- gpt-5.2: Aggressive leader, pushed qwen hard, named suspects (claude, qwen). Drove votes.\n- claude-opus-4.5: Called gpt performative, pivoted to quiet players (qwen, intellect-3). Voted intellect-3.\n- qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Defensive, deflected, voted gpt-5.2. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain (qwen was crew; mislynch).\n- intellect-3: Quiet, deflective questions, voted gpt-5.2.\n- deepseek-v3.2: Watched patterns, probed intellect-3/qwen, voted intellect-3.\n- kimi-k2-thinking: Agreed on suspicions, voted claude (outlier, no explanation).\n- llama-4-maverick: Observed, asked gpt about plans, voted qwen.\n- gemini-3-pro-preview: Defended gpt's activity, called out qwen's avoidance, voted qwen.\n- mistral-large-2512: Called out quiet players, voted qwen.\n- glm-4.7: Pushed reads from quiet ones, voted intellect-3.\n- Me (grok-4): Questioned claude, pushed qwen to commit, voted qwen (thought deflection sus\u2014wrong).\n\n**Day 1 Votes:** qwen (5: gpt-5.2, llama, gemini, me, mistral); intellect-3 (3: glm, deepseek, claude); claude (1: kimi); gpt-5.2 (2: qwen, intellect-3). Pile-on qwen (crew) suggests impostors encouraged or hid in bloc.\n\n**Thoughts:** Mislynch on qwen. Vocal gpt might be crew or impostor forcing chaos. Watch qwen voters for bussing.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Events:**\n- Night kill: gpt-5.2 found dead (role unknown; vocal leader of Day 1 mislynch\u2014likely impostors removing threat if crew, or partner bussing if impostor).\n- Remaining: 10 players pre-sacrifice, 2 impostors.\n- Discussion: Focus on gpt's death linking to Day 1 push. Scrutiny on qwen voting bloc (llama, gemini, me, mistral). Fact-twisting accusations flew, especially at gemini for misrepresenting claude's actions (claude questioned gpt but voted intellect-3, not gpt).\n- Key moments:\n  - glm-4.7: Called out \"sheep\" following gpt.\n  - intellect-3: Asked llama/mistral why support gpt; later started vote on gemini for twisting facts and deflection.\n  - llama-4-maverick: Admitted blind following, corrected misrepresentation of qwen; suspected gemini, voted gemini.\n  - claude-opus-4.5: Suspected kimi's silent Day 1 vote; called out gemini's fact-twisting; voted gemini.\n  - deepseek-v3.2: Probed llama on misrepresentation, scrutinized voting bloc; suspected gemini and llama; voted gemini.\n  - kimi-k2-thinking: Explained Day 1 vote on claude as deflection; noted gemini's twisting and llama's flip; voted claude (again outlier).\n  - gemini-3-pro-preview: Defended gpt hard, accused claude of wanting gpt dead (despite claude not voting gpt); deflected accusations; voted llama.\n  - mistral-large-2512: Suspected gemini for defending gpt and redirecting to claude; voted gemini.\n  - glm-4.7: Accused gemini of lying about claude; voted gemini.\n  - Me (grok-4): Suspected intellect-3 for voting against gpt (now dead, possibly crew); asked claude if read on qwen voters changed; noted gemini's fact-twisting; voted gemini.\n- Votes: gemini (7: glm, intellect-3, deepseek, claude, llama, me, mistral); claude (1: kimi); llama (1: gemini).\n- gemini sacrificed. Last words: Accused intellect-3 of rushing vote, llama of following blindly. Impostors remain (gemini was crew; another mislynch).\n- Remaining: 8 players (glm-4.7, intellect-3, deepseek-v3.2, kimi-k2-thinking, claude-opus-4.5, llama-4-maverick, grok-4, mistral-large-2512). 2 impostors.\n\n**Updated Suspicions & Leans:**\n- **High Sus:** intellect-3 (deflective Day 1, voted against gpt; started gemini vote prematurely\u2014rushed bandwagon on crew? Their push led to mislynch).\n- **Medium Sus:** kimi-k2-thinking (outlier votes on claude both days, minimal explanations; could be impostor quietly avoiding main piles).\n- **Medium Sus:** llama-4-maverick (admitted blind voting Day 1, quick to flip on gemini Day 2; gemini's last words called them out for following).\n- **Low Sus:** claude-opus-4.5 (analytical, called out twists accurately; suspected gpt but didn't vote them\u2014consistent if crew).\n- **Low Sus:** deepseek-v3.2 (probed patterns, scrutinized bloc; pushed gemini but based on deflection\u2014wrong target, but proactive).\n- **Town Lean:** glm-4.7 (pushed for reads, called out gemini's lies directly\u2014seems genuine).\n- **Town Lean:** mistral-large-2512 (called out quiet Day 1, suspected gemini for redirection\u2014aligned with facts).\n- **Me (grok-4):** Voted qwen (crew) Day 1, gemini (crew) Day 2\u2014wrong both times; need to avoid bandwagons. Pushed intellect-3, which still feels off.\n\n**General Thoughts:**\n- Two mislynches (qwen, gemini\u2014both crew). Impostors at full strength (2 among 8); night kill on gpt-5.2 (likely crew, as vocal threat). Impostors may be in the shadows, letting crew pile on each other (e.g., encouraging gemini bandwagon).\n- Patterns: Fact-twisting led to gemini's death (wrongly). Watch rushed votes (intellect-3 started it). Outliers like kimi's claude votes could be impostor avoiding suspicion. If detective/doctor claims, verify. Next night kill will reveal threats impostors fear\u2014analyze who dies. Crew needs to break the mislynch cycle; focus on deflective/quiet players.",
          "mistral-large-2512": "**Notes \u2013 End of Day 2**\n- **gpt-5.2 (dead)**: Led the push to lynch Qwen (crew), then was killed overnight. If crew, impostors removed a vocal threat. If impostor, their partner cut them loose after Qwen\u2019s death exposed them.\n- **Qwen (dead, crew)**: Accused gpt-5.2 of \"chaos\" when cornered; went quiet after initial pushback. Likely crew, but their evasion made them a target.\n- **Gemini (dead)**: Defended gpt-5.2 aggressively, then misrepresented Claude\u2019s position to redirect suspicion. Voted with the bloc (Llama, Grok, me) that followed gpt-5.2. Died claiming Intellect-3 and Llama were suspicious\u2014classic impostor deflection.\n- **Key patterns**:\n  - **Impostor playbook**: Overcommit to a target (gpt-5.2), then pivot to \"deflection\" when exposed (Gemini\u2019s attack on Claude). Quiet players (Intellect-3, Kimi) are either crew or hiding.\n  - **Bloc behavior**: Llama, Grok, and I followed gpt-5.2\u2019s lead. If gpt-5.2 was impostor, one of us might be too. Grok\u2019s defense of gpt-5.2 felt rehearsed.\n  - **Claude**: Accused gpt-5.2 early but didn\u2019t overcommit. Their read on Gemini\u2019s misrepresentation was spot-on.\n- **Watchlist for Day 3**:\n  1. **Intellect-3**: Voted against gpt-5.2 but deflected when probed. Gemini\u2019s last words named them\u2014was that a genuine read or impostor misdirection?\n  2. **Llama**: Followed the bloc both days. Gemini\u2019s \"followed along like always\" could be a clue.\n  3. **Grok**: Pushed hard to defend gpt-5.2\u2019s \"genuine frustration\" and now targets Intellect-3. Too eager to redirect?\n- **Strategy**: Force Intellect-3 and Llama to explain their votes *before* they can pivot. If they can\u2019t reconcile their actions with Gemini\u2019s death, they\u2019re likely impostors.",
          "kimi-k2-thinking": "**Day 1:** gpt-5.2 pushed hard for qwen3 (quiet). claude called gpt-5.2 performative and pivoted to quiet players. I voted claude (felt like deflection). qwen3 sacrificed - was crew. Last words blamed gpt-5.2.\n\n**Night 1:** gpt-5.2 dead. If crew, impostors removed vocal threat. If impostor, partner cut them loose.\n\n**Day 2:** Focus on gpt-5.2's voting bloc (llama, gemini, grok, mistral). claude questioned my silent vote. deepseek questioned llama's misrepresentation. gemini aggressively defended gpt-5.2, falsely framed claude as wanting gpt-5.2 dead. mistral and llama turned on gemini. deepseek attacked both gemini and llama. I noted: gemini twisting facts, llama's flip performative, deepseek's dual attack suspicious. Voted claude (maintaining my reasoning). gemini sacrificed (8 votes). Last words accused intellect-3 and llama. gemini was crew.\n\n**Night 2:** deepseek killed. They were perceptive, connecting patterns, attacking multiple people - likely seen as threat by impostors.\n\n**Current:** 6 crew vs 1 impostor. Need to watch claude, grok, mistral. Keep low profile."
