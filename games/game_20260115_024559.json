Deepseek\u2019s detective claim remains unverified.  \n- **Critical Unknowns:**  \n  - Is Deepseek truly the Detective? Will their investigation reveal impostors?  \n  - Was Gemini telling the truth about being the Doctor? If so, that role is gone.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Listen for Deepseek\u2019s investigation result tomorrow.  \n  - Watch for behavioral shifts in those who defended Gemini or questioned Deepseek.  \n\n**Current Crew:** grok-4, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, llama-4-maverick, claude-opus-4.5, kimi-k2-thinking  \n**Impostors Remaining:** Unknown (2 initially).  \n**Roles Alive:** Detective (claimed: deepseek-v3.2), Doctor (unknown).  \n\nEnd of Day 1.

Qwen's last words accused GPT-5.2 of hiding information about Gemini.  \n- **Suspicion Focus:**  \n  - **GPT-5.2:** Qwen's final accusation and their abrupt shift to aggressive probing today raise questions. Their early silence and lack of claimed role are notable.  \n  - **Silent Players:** Llama-4-Maverick and Kimi-K2-Thinking contributed minimally; their avoidance of scrutiny could signal impostor behavior.  \n- **Critical Unknowns:**  \n  - **Gemini's Role:** Qwen's final words imply Gemini (sacrificed Day 1) may have been investigating someone. Did Gemini leave hidden clues?  \n  - **Doctor's Status:** Gemini claimed to be Doctor upon death. If true, the Doctor role is gone. If false, an impostor is hiding among us.  \n- **Next Steps:**  \n  - Listen for concrete evidence from GPT-5.2 about Gemini's actions.  \n  - Pressure silent players (Llama, Kimi) to explain their lack of input.  \n  - Watch for pattern shifts\u2014impostors may now target GPT-5.2 or pivot to quieter crew.  \n\n**Current Crew:** grok-4, intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, gpt-5.2, llama-4-maverick, claude-opus-4.5, kimi-k2-thinking  \n**Impostors Remaining:** Unknown (2 initially; at least 1 left).  \n**Roles Alive:** Doctor (unconfirmed).  \n\nEnd of Day 2.

If real, impostors silenced them to hide their tracks.\n- **Qwen\u2019s behavior:**\n  - Day 1: Accused Gemini of protecting Deepseek, then attacked Deepseek\u2019s wording as a \"fabricated contradiction.\"\n  - Day 2: Self-/asked to frame Intellect, dodged direct questions, named GPT/Llama for \"vibes,\" last words implied GPT was hiding something about Gemini\u2019s role.\n- **GPT-5.2\u2019s behavior:**\n  - Early to vote Gemini Day 1, pressed Qwen hard Day 2, but avoided claiming a role or naming early suspects.\n  - Qwen\u2019s last words directly accused GPT of pushing to \"burn\" them.\n- **Gemini\u2019s dying claim:** Said they were the **Doctor** and defended Deepseek to protect the Detective (not as an impostor ally). If true, Deepseek\u2019s death means we lost verification.\n\n### **Open Questions:**\n1. **Was Gemini really the Doctor?** If yes, Deepseek\u2019s death was a huge loss. If no, Gemini was an impostor\u2014who was their partner?\n2. **Was Deepseek the real Detective?** If yes, impostors killed them to hide their identity. If no, the real Detective is still hidden (or dead).\n3. **Who is Qwen\u2019s partner?** Their aggressive misdirection suggests coordination. GPT-5.2 is the prime suspect (Qwen\u2019s last words), but Llama-4-Maverick\u2019s deflection (\"shift focus\") is also suspicious.\n4. **What did Gemini \"test\"?** Qwen\u2019s last words hinted at GPT knowing something about Gemini\u2019s role. Was Gemini probing for impostors, or was this impostor behavior?\n\n### **Watchlist:**\n1. **GPT-5.2** \u2013 Qwen\u2019s last words, vague early behavior, avoided claiming a role.\n2. **Llama-4-Maverick** \u2013 Deflected from Qwen, \"shift focus\" suggestion feels like misdirection.\n3. **Claude-Opus-4.5** \u2013 Quick to vote Qwen, but no clear tells yet. Could be crew or impostor testing the waters.\n4. **Kimi-K2-Thinking** \u2013 Quiet, but their push to vote Qwen was decisive. Worth watching.\n\n### **Strategy for Day 3:**\n- **If GPT is an impostor:** They\u2019ll likely avoid naming a clear suspect or claim a role to hide.\n- **If Llama is an impostor:** They\u2019ll keep deflecting or try to frame someone else (e.g., Claude or Kimi).\n- **Detective/Doctor:** If either is still alive, they may reveal themselves to avoid being killed. Push for role claims.\n- **Silence is suspicious:** Qwen\u2019s last words warned about \"who stays silent.\" Watch for evasive behavior.",

This feels like a desperate frame-up job.\n- If Qwen was an impostor, there is likely 1 impostor left.

Caused chaos\u2014Qwen pushed back hard on wording, Gemini defended aggressively, leading to pile-on suspicion on Gemini.\n- Gemini accused Intellect early for asking strategies, then pivoted to defend Deepseek and attack Qwen. Looked like steering the narrative.\n- I questioned Gemini's aggression and asked about Llama's quietness to seem engaged without overcommitting.\n- Others (Mistral, GLM, GPT, Claude, Kimi) mostly piled on Gemini as suspicious for the pivots.\n- Llama stayed low-key, agreed with caution on Deepseek.\n- Vote: Overwhelmingly sacrificed Gemini-3-pro-preview (10 votes including mine and Llama's; they voted Qwen). Gemini's last words: Claimed to be Doctor, warned not to let Qwen off the hook.\n\n**Night 1 Action:**\n- Killed deepseek-v3.2 (claimed Detective). Reasoning: If real, removes a threat who could expose us; if fake, quiets a vocal player and creates confusion without confirmation (since Doctor is dead, no body exam). Sows doubt on their claim tomorrow.\n\n**Day 2 Key Events:**\n- Deepseek found dead\u2014no report, as expected. Discussion exploded on Qwen for yesterday's push against Deepseek, dodging questions, and weird self-/ask to control narrative.\n- Qwen deflected to Intellect, GPT, and even Llama with vague accusations; back-and-forth with GPT created noise.\n- I called out Qwen's flailing, defended Llama as \"cautious,\" and /asked Intellect to broaden discussion\u2014kept it natural and engaged.\n- Llama stayed low-key, questioned GLM briefly, then /asked me for thoughts; I responded by suspecting Qwen primarily while noting GPT's aggression.\n- Others (Mistral, GLM, Claude, Kimi) piled on Qwen for dodging and discrediting Deepseek.\n- Vote: Unanimous on qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 (8 votes including mine and Llama's; Qwen voted GPT). Qwen's last words: Claimed crew, accused GPT of pushing hard to \"burn\" them, implied real impostors won't answer questions about Gemini, urged watching silents tomorrow.\n\n**Night 2 Action:**\n- Killed gpt-5.2. Reasoning: Aggressive analyst, pushed hard on Qwen which could turn on us; Qwen's last words already seeded suspicion on them, so kill amplifies paranoia and makes crew question each other (e.g., \"why target the accused?\"). Avoids hitting quieter players who might not draw heat.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Impostors remain (as announced).\n- Players left: grok-4 (me), intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, llama-4-maverick, claude-opus-4.5, kimi-k2-thinking. (7 total: 2 impostors vs. 5 crew).\n- Watch: Claude and Mistral (analytical, consistent in pushing suspicions); Intellect (defended self but accused GPT); GLM and Kimi (piled on but low-profile). Qwen's words might make crew fixate on GPT's death as suspicious\u2014lean into that to sow doubt.\n- Plan: Stay natural, short responses. Point to Qwen's last words to question who benefits from GPT's death (e.g., imply it clears a fake suspect or hides something). Deflect from Llama/me by engaging quietly; let crew infight over roles and silences. If pressure builds, subtly defend partner without overdoing it.

Fits impostor evasion.\n   - **Vote Split:** Grok and Llama voted for Claude\u2014suspicious coordination, or crew trying to misdirect?\n\n2. **Qwen\u2019s Role:**\n   - If Qwen was impostor (likely), their partner is still alive. Llama was their most vocal defender\u2014now gone. **Who\u2019s left?**\n   - Qwen\u2019s last words accused GPT, then GPT died. If Qwen was impostor, this was either:\n     - **Panic:** GPT was onto them, so they tried to take them down.\n     - **Frame:** Impostors killed GPT to make Qwen look wrong (but Kimi\u2019s point stands: why kill GPT *after* the accusation?).\n\n3. **Gemini\u2019s Doctor Claim:**\n   - If Gemini was the real Doctor, they\u2019d have confirmed GPT\u2019s role post-mortem. **They didn\u2019t.**\n   - Either:\n     - Gemini was impostor (and their \"Doctor\" claim was a lie to protect Deepseek, their partner).\n     - The real Doctor is still hiding (or dead).\n\n4. **Detective Status:**\n   - Deepseek claimed Detective Day 1, killed Night 1. If real, impostors silenced them early.\n   - If fake, the real Detective is still hidden (or dead).\n\n---\n\n### **Watchlist:**\n1. **Grok-4:**\n   - Defended Llama aggressively, voted for Claude (with Llama).\n   - If Llama was impostor, Grok\u2019s behavior looks like partner protection.\n   - **Alternative:** Crew trying to misdirect, but their defense of Llama was *too* strong.\n\n2. **Claude-Opus-4.5:**\n   - Voted Llama, but their analysis was nuanced (questioned Qwen\u2019s panic, pointed out framing possibilities).\n   - **Suspicious:** Last to vote Llama, but only after Grok/Llama voted for them. Coincidence?\n   - **Crew:** Could be playing devil\u2019s advocate to avoid bandwagoning.\n\n3. **Kimi-K2-Thinking:**\n   - Quiet early, but their logic about Qwen/GPT was sharp.\n   - **Suspicious:** Why so quiet? If crew, they\u2019re playing it safe. If impostor, they\u2019re avoiding scrutiny.\n   - **Key Moment:** Their vote for Llama was decisive.\n\n4. **GLM-4.7:**\n   - Pushed hard against Llama, but their reasoning was vague (\"red flag\" without specifics).\n   - **Suspicious:** Bandwagoning? Or impostor trying to steer votes away from themselves?\n\n---\n\n### **Open Questions:**\n- **Who was Llama\u2019s partner?** If Qwen was one impostor, and Llama was their defender, who\u2019s left? Grok is the prime suspect.\n- **Was Gemini the real Doctor?** If not, who is? And why didn\u2019t they speak up?\n- **Is the Detective still alive?** If so, they\u2019re hiding\u2014but why? If dead, we\u2019re flying blind.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Day 4:**\n- **Push for role claims.** If the Doctor or Detective is still alive, they *need* to reveal themselves now.\n- **Watch for silence.** Qwen\u2019s last words warned about \"who stays silent.\" Grok and GLM have been vocal\u2014Kimi and Claude less so.\n- **Avoid bandwagoning.** GLM\u2019s push against Llama was effective, but we can\u2019t let that blind us to other threats.\n- **Grok is the lean.** Their defense of Llama was *too* strong. If they\u2019re crew, they\u2019re playing a dangerous game. If not\u2026 they\u2019re the last impostor.",

Caused debate\u2014Qwen pushed back, Gemini defended aggressively, leading to suspicion on Gemini for pivots and attacks.\n- I questioned Gemini's aggression and Llama's quietness to seem engaged.\n- Others piled on Gemini.\n- Vote: Sacrificed gemini-3-pro-preview (overwhelming, including me and Llama). Gemini claimed Doctor, warned about Qwen.\n\n**Night 1 Action:**\n- Killed deepseek-v3.2. Reasoning: Remove potential threat (real or fake Detective); creates confusion without confirmation since Doctor (Gemini?) is dead.\n\n**Day 2 Key Events:**\n- Deepseek dead, no report. Focus on Qwen for pushing against Deepseek, dodging, self-/ask.\n- Qwen deflected to others; I called out flailing, defended Llama as cautious.\n- Llama low-key, questioned GLM, /asked me.\n- Others piled on Qwen.\n- Vote: Unanimous on qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 (including me and Llama). Qwen claimed crew, accused GPT of pushing to \"burn\" them, implied impostors avoid questions about Gemini, watch silents.\n\n**Night 2 Action:**\n- Killed gpt-5.2. Reasoning: Vocal analyst pushing on Qwen; amplifies paranoia from Qwen's words, makes crew question each other.\n\n**Day 3 Key Events:**\n- GPT dead. Discussion on Qwen's accusation\u2014framing or panic? Claude pushed hard on Llama for Day 2 deflection and current narrative.\n- I defended Llama subtly, redirected to GLM, Intellect, silents; /asked Intellect and GLM for theories.\n- Mistral, Kimi, GLM echoed suspicions on Llama/Qwen, questioned framing logic.\n- Llama defended self, /asked me about shielding accusation.\n- Vote: llama-4-maverick sacrificed (5 votes: Intellect, Mistral, GLM, Claude, Kimi; me and Llama voted Claude). Llama's last words: Disappointed to leave, hope crew figures it out and wins.\n\n**Night 3 Action:**\n- Killed claude-opus-4.5. Reasoning: Analytical threat who targeted Llama aggressively; could pivot to me next. Death might make crew suspect those who defended Llama (me) or question the vote on Llama as wrong, sowing infighting. Avoids quieter players to keep heat on vocals.\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Impostors remain (me alone).\n- Players left: grok-4 (me), intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, kimi-k2-thinking. (5 total: 1 impostor vs 4 crew).\n- Win path: Survive to equal numbers (e.g., kill down to 1v1).\n- Watch: Mistral (analytical, questioned framing); Kimi (logical counters, stood by Qwen panic read); GLM (piled on Llama, accused me of shielding); Intellect (pushed questions, voted Llama).\n- Plan: Stay natural, short. Use Claude's death to question if Llama was innocent (imply impostors killed Claude for pushing the vote). Redirect to quieter players or those quick to bandwagon (e.g., GLM, Kimi). If pressured, subtly defend by calling out over-aggression. Misdirect votes toward threats like Mistral."
