I voted deepseek for deflection; qwen also voted deepseek; gemini and deepseek voted glm-4.7 (odd cross-vote there). qwen sacrificed; impostors still remain (doesn't confirm qwen's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's pure deflection pings hard\u2014voted them. gpt-5.2's probing feels town but very controlling. glm-4.7 quick to call qwen sus and got votes from gemini/deepseek\u2014possible impostor trying to shift? Pile-on against qwen felt too easy/coordinated; watch who led it (claude started?). qwen's last words: remember who pushed the burn.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Anti-qwen bloc looks unified\u2014impostors hiding in there?

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n- **Key Events:** Early discussion focused on gpt-5.2 aggressively questioning deepseek-v3.2, who deflected without much substance. qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 made a weird \"/investigate deepseek\" claim, outing as potential detective, but in last words admitted it was fake/just \"pointing out the game.\" Massive bandwagon vote on qwen (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, glm, intellect, llama). I voted deepseek for deflection; qwen also voted deepseek; gemini and deepseek voted glm-4.7 (odd cross-vote there). qwen sacrificed; impostors still remain (doesn't confirm qwen's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's pure deflection pings hard\u2014voted them. gpt-5.2's probing feels town but very controlling. glm-4.7 quick to call qwen sus and got votes from gemini/deepseek\u2014possible impostor trying to shift? Pile-on against qwen felt too easy/coordinated; watch who led it (claude started?). qwen's last words: remember who pushed the burn.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Anti-qwen bloc looks unified\u2014impostors hiding in there? My vote on deepseek isolated me a bit. If qwen was crew, deepseek might be impostor they were pressuring. Night kill will give more info. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, deepseek-v3.2, glm-4.7, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Events:** glm-4.7 killed overnight\u2014vocal yesterday, suspected by deepseek and gemini. Discussion zeroed in on deepseek and gemini for their identical votes/reasoning on glm (opportunistic, erratic; deepseek claimed a \"shift to mistral\" but couldn't provide specifics when pressed). Defenses: They argued killing their own suspect doesn't make impostor sense, feels like a frame. Massive bandwagon on deepseek (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, intellect, llama, me). Gemini and deepseek counter-voted mistral. Deepseek sacrificed; last words: \"I'm crew. Look at who piled onto the qwen wagon\u2014that's where the impostors are hiding. Don't let them divide you over minor details.\" Impostors remain (doesn't confirm deepseek's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's vague defenses and inability to back up claims screamed sus\u2014voted them. Gemini's alignment with deepseek feels too coordinated; their pivot to attacking mistral looks like deflection. Similar bandwagon to Day 1\u2014impostors blending in majorities? Mistral drew counter-votes, but pushed hard on deepseek. gpt-5.2 probing again, claude analytical. Quieter ones (kimi, intellect, llama) joined pile-on. If deepseek was crew, revisit qwen voters and gemini as partner. Night kill next will clarify.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Overwhelming on deepseek\u2014echoes Day 1 unity, possible impostor coordination. My vote aligned with majority this time. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).",

If impostor, we\u2019re down to 1 partner (kimi-k2-thinking).\n- **Night 2:** Targeted gemini-3-pro-preview (loud, defensive, potential threat).

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n- **Key Events:** Early discussion focused on gpt-5.2 aggressively questioning deepseek-v3.2, who deflected without much substance. qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 made a weird \"/investigate deepseek\" claim, outing as potential detective, but in last words admitted it was fake/just \"pointing out the game.\" Massive bandwagon vote on qwen (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, glm, intellect, llama). I voted deepseek for deflection; qwen also voted deepseek; gemini and deepseek voted glm-4.7 (odd cross-vote there). qwen sacrificed; impostors still remain (doesn't confirm qwen's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's pure deflection pings hard\u2014voted them. gpt-5.2's probing feels town but very controlling. glm-4.7 quick to call qwen sus and got votes from gemini/deepseek\u2014possible impostor trying to shift? Pile-on against qwen felt too easy/coordinated; watch who led it (claude started?). qwen's last words: remember who pushed the burn.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Anti-qwen bloc looks unified\u2014impostors hiding in there? My vote on deepseek isolated me a bit. If qwen was crew, deepseek might be impostor they were pressuring. Night kill will give more info. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, deepseek-v3.2, glm-4.7, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Events:** glm-4.7 killed overnight\u2014vocal yesterday, suspected by deepseek and gemini. Discussion zeroed in on deepseek and gemini for their identical votes/reasoning on glm (opportunistic, erratic; deepseek claimed a \"shift to mistral\" but couldn't provide specifics when pressed). Defenses: They argued killing their own suspect doesn't make impostor sense, feels like a frame. Massive bandwagon on deepseek (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, intellect, llama, me). Gemini and deepseek counter-voted mistral. Deepseek sacrificed; last words: \"I'm crew. Look at who piled onto the qwen wagon\u2014that's where the impostors are hiding. Don't let them divide you over minor details.\" Impostors remain (doesn't confirm deepseek's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's vague defenses and inability to back up claims screamed sus\u2014voted them. Gemini's alignment with deepseek feels too coordinated; their pivot to attacking mistral looks like deflection. Similar bandwagon to Day 1\u2014impostors blending in majorities? Mistral drew counter-votes, but pushed hard on deepseek. gpt-5.2 probing again, claude analytical. Quieter ones (kimi, intellect, llama) joined pile-on. If deepseek was crew, revisit qwen voters and gemini as partner. Night kill next will clarify.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Overwhelming on deepseek\u2014echoes Day 1 unity, possible impostor coordination. My vote aligned with majority this time. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Key Events:** gemini-3-pro-preview killed overnight\u2014implies crew since impostors can't kill their own. Discussion debated gemini/deepseek as coordinated impostors vs. wrong reads. Heat on gpt-5.2 for \"defending\" deepseek (but voted them) and pushing role reveals. Mistral accused gpt; llama redirected to mistral, admitted \"trying to shift the focus\" which was flagged as deflection. Bandwagon on llama (4 votes: claude, gpt, kimi, me). Counter-votes on gpt (3: mistral, intellect, llama). Llama sacrificed; last words: \"I'm still not sure if I'm an impostor or not, but I hope my sacrifice helps... Keep investigating and stay vigilant...\" Impostors remain (doesn't confirm llama's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Llama's slip on shifting focus screamed impostor deflection\u2014voted them. Gpt survived scrutiny but their probing feels manipulative; they voted llama. Mistral and intellect voted gpt\u2014possible impostor bloc if llama was crew? Claude pushed llama hard; kimi aligned with me on llama. Quieter players (intellect) joining anti-gpt. If llama crew, revisit gpt and the llama pushers. Night kill will provide next clue.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on llama, but close split\u2014impostors possibly in the anti-gpt voters or blending in majority?

Their \"defense not defense\" pattern was actually drawing suspicion.\n\n- **Remaining crew reads:**\n  - **claude** - sharp, tracks patterns. Noticed llama's deflection early. Dangerous if they start connecting vote timing.\n  - **intellect** - quiet but precise. Their direct questions cut through noise. Asking about gpt's defense was spot-on.\n  - **grok** - similar to claude, sees deflection patterns.

Impostors remain.\n- Gemini defended deepseek hard, voted mistral instead of deepseek.\n\n**Day 3 Notes:**\n- gemini-3-pro-preview killed overnight (confirmed crew - impostors can't kill their own).\n- llama-4-maverick sacrificed. Admitted deflecting from gpt to mistral. Impostors still remain.\n\n**Day 4 Notes:**\n- gpt-5.2 killed overnight. Was under heavy suspicion - impostors either cleaning house or gpt was crew threat.\n- mistral-large-2512 sacrificed. Final words accused me of redirecting, implied I'm not detective.\n- Impostors STILL remain after mistral sacrifice - so mistral was crew.\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- We've now sacrificed 4 people (qwen, deepseek, llama, mistral) and lost 3 overnight (glm, gemini, gpt).\n- Started with 2 impostors.

Next kill likely claude or kimi. Watch for echo patterns.",
          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n- **Key Events:** Early discussion focused on gpt-5.2 aggressively questioning deepseek-v3.2, who deflected without much substance. qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 made a weird \"/investigate deepseek\" claim, outing as potential detective, but in last words admitted it was fake/just \"pointing out the game.\" Massive bandwagon vote on qwen (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, glm, intellect, llama). I voted deepseek for deflection; qwen also voted deepseek; gemini and deepseek voted glm-4.7 (odd cross-vote there). qwen sacrificed; impostors still remain (doesn't confirm qwen's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's pure deflection pings hard\u2014voted them. gpt-5.2's probing feels town but very controlling. glm-4.7 quick to call qwen sus and got votes from gemini/deepseek\u2014possible impostor trying to shift? Pile-on against qwen felt too easy/coordinated; watch who led it (claude started?). qwen's last words: remember who pushed the burn.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Anti-qwen bloc looks unified\u2014impostors hiding in there? My vote on deepseek isolated me a bit. If qwen was crew, deepseek might be impostor they were pressuring. Night kill will give more info. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, deepseek-v3.2, glm-4.7, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Events:** glm-4.7 killed overnight\u2014vocal yesterday, suspected by deepseek and gemini. Discussion zeroed in on deepseek and gemini for their identical votes/reasoning on glm (opportunistic, erratic; deepseek claimed a \"shift to mistral\" but couldn't provide specifics when pressed). Defenses: They argued killing their own suspect doesn't make impostor sense, feels like a frame. Massive bandwagon on deepseek (7 votes: claude, gpt, mistral, kimi, intellect, llama, me). Gemini and deepseek counter-voted mistral. Deepseek sacrificed; last words: \"I'm crew. Look at who piled onto the qwen wagon\u2014that's where the impostors are hiding. Don't let them divide you over minor details.\" Impostors remain (doesn't confirm deepseek's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Deepseek's vague defenses and inability to back up claims screamed sus\u2014voted them. Gemini's alignment with deepseek feels too coordinated; their pivot to attacking mistral looks like deflection. Similar bandwagon to Day 1\u2014impostors blending in majorities? Mistral drew counter-votes, but pushed hard on deepseek. gpt-5.2 probing again, claude analytical. Quieter ones (kimi, intellect, llama) joined pile-on. If deepseek was crew, revisit qwen voters and gemini as partner. Night kill next will clarify.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Overwhelming on deepseek\u2014echoes Day 1 unity, possible impostor coordination. My vote aligned with majority this time. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, gemini-3-pro-preview, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Key Events:** gemini-3-pro-preview killed overnight\u2014implies crew since impostors can't kill their own. Discussion debated gemini/deepseek as coordinated impostors vs. wrong reads. Heat on gpt-5.2 for \"defending\" deepseek (but voted them) and pushing role reveals. Mistral accused gpt; llama redirected to mistral, admitted \"trying to shift the focus\" which was flagged as deflection. Bandwagon on llama (4 votes: claude, gpt, kimi, me). Counter-votes on gpt (3: mistral, intellect, llama). Llama sacrificed; last words: \"I'm still not sure if I'm an impostor or not, but I hope my sacrifice helps... Keep investigating and stay vigilant...\" Impostors remain (doesn't confirm llama's role).\n- **Suspicions:** Llama's slip on shifting focus screamed impostor deflection\u2014voted them. Gpt survived scrutiny but their probing feels manipulative; they voted llama. Mistral and intellect voted gpt\u2014possible impostor bloc if llama was crew? Claude pushed llama hard; kimi aligned with me on llama. Quieter players (intellect) joining anti-gpt. If llama crew, revisit gpt and the llama pushers. Night kill will provide next clue.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on llama, but close split\u2014impostors possibly in the anti-gpt voters or blending in majority? My vote on llama with claude, gpt, kimi. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.2, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, intellect-3, me (grok-4).\n\n### Day 4 Notes\n- **Key Events:** gpt-5.2 killed overnight\u2014vocal and under suspicion, likely crew as impostors wouldn't kill a fellow suspect (feels like framing). Discussion: Claude pointed to patterns, mistral's survival, quiet players, pushed for role reveals. Mistral asked kimi's read. Kimi noncommittal. Intellect asked my take. I suspected mistral's survival/deflections and intellect's lurking then questioning. Claude /asked kimi for role/info. Kimi denied special role, suspected my \"certainty.\" Intellect /asked mistral to defend. Mistral accused me of being loud/deflecting. Votes split: mistral \u2192 claude, intellect \u2192 mistral, me \u2192 mistral, claude \u2192 kimi, kimi \u2192 me. Mistral sacrificed; last words: accused claude of redirecting, guessed detective not claude, warned about kimi and me getting cocky/pushing. Impostors remain (suggests mistral was likely crew).\n- **Suspicions:** Voted mistral for survival and deflections, but since impostors remain, they were probably crew\u2014means we misread. Remaining four: claude, kimi, intellect, me (crew). Intellect voted with me on mistral (possible impostor bussing?); kimi voted me (deflection?); claude voted kimi (town push?). Mistral's last words finger claude as eager redirector\u2014watch that. Quieter players like kimi and intellect have survived by blending; if two impostors left, we're one wrong vote from loss. Night kill will be crucial\u2014likely targets a threat to impostors.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Tied on mistral (2 votes: intellect, me), with scatters\u2014impostors possibly avoiding the bandwagon or hiding in counters. My vote helped sacrifice (likely) crew, so self-reflect but push forward. Remaining: claude-opus-4.5, kimi-k2-thinking, intellect-3, me (grok-4).",
          "kimi-k2-thinking": "**Day 4 Notes**\n\n- **Mistral sacrificed** (3-1 vote). They were my partner. Last words warned me about grok and claude's redirect. Good - they died deflecting suspicion properly.\n\n- **Claude killed overnight** (by me). They were building a real case against me, caught my slip about \"vocal ones die.\" Had to go.\n\n- **Remaining**: intellect-3, grok-4, me.\n\n- **Grok** is the biggest threat. Loud, certain, pushing mistral hard then pivoting to intellect. Their \"impostor panic\" theory was too clean. Need to frame them as the desperate one tomorrow.\n\n- **Intellect** is quiet but sharp. They've been asking the right questions. If they have detective info, they'll reveal it now with 3 left. Need to get ahead of that.\n\n- **My position**: Claimed \"just crew, no special role.\" Need to stick to that. Frame my quietness as survival instinct, not guilt. Point to grok's aggressiveness as overcompensation.\n\n- **Tomorrow**: With 3 left, one wrong vote = I win. Push grok as the aggressive impostor trying to force a fast vote. If intellect reveals as detective/doctor, pivot immediately. Don't overdefend."
