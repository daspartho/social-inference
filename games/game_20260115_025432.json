They refused to share suspicions multiple times, only finally naming me as sus for \"pivoting\" to intellect-3 (I pointed out their self-repetition as odd when GPT directly asked for my second ping).\n- Suspicion built on qwen; some (claude, glm) flipped to me late, calling my response a misdirect. I stuck with qwen as top sus for info withholding.\n- No kills yet, pure discussion.\n\n**Key Interactions:**\n- Claude: Opened neutrally, defended self, later suspected me over pivot. Voted me.\n- qwen: Deflective, aggressive, finally accused me. Voted me. Sacrificed; impostors remain (so could be crew or impostor).\n- glm: Echoed group, low original input; flipped to vote me late.\n- gpt: Pushed qwen hard for reads, asked me for second ping, stuck with voting qwen.\n- gemini: Called out qwen's deflection, voted qwen.\n- kimi: Supported pushing qwen, voted qwen.\n- intellect: Noted qwen's deflection but called my ping on them \"forced.\" Voted qwen.

Claude (quick flip to me after qwen engaged, voted me\u2014could be protecting qwen if impostor).\n- Medium sus: intellect (odd repetition, defended against my ping aggressively).\n- Town lean: gpt (pushed for info consistently), gemini/kimi (direct on qwen), llama/deepseek/mistral (voted qwen, reasonable takes).\n- If qwen was impostor, watch who defended them (claude/glm). If crew, my \"pivot\" drew coordinated suspicion\u2014possible impostors in claude/glm pile-on.\n- 10 left, 2 impostors total\u2014need to eliminate both. Watch for night kill patterns tomorrow.",

Either genuine confusion or impostor slip.\n- gemini-3-pro-preview caught llama's error immediately and defended grok aggressively all day. Called my analysis \"pure manipulation.\"\n- grok's final words accused llama and called out \"coordinated tunneling\" - typical impostor deflection or genuine crew frustration?\n\n**Current reads:**\n1. **gemini-3-pro-preview** - TOP SUSPECT. Aggressive defense of grok felt like partner behavior. If grok was impostor, gemini likely is too.\n2. **llama-4-maverick** - False doctor claim is deeply suspicious. Either confused crew or impostor trying to gain authority.\n3. **glm-4.7** - Has voted with me both days. Could be genuine alignment or impostor shadowing my reads.\n\n**Less suspicious:**\n- kimi-k2-thinking, intellect-3, deepseek-v3.2, mistral-large-2512 - Following discussion, contributing but not leading suspiciously.\n\n**Key question for Day 3:**\n- If grok was impostor, gemini is almost certainly the other one.\n- If grok was crew, I need to reassess - llama's false claim becomes more damning.\n- Watch for who pushes hardest against the grok voters tomorrow.\n\n**Priority:** Press gemini-3-pro-preview hard.
