I'm crew and the doctor\u2014examine sacrificed body each night to check if impostor.\n- No deaths yet at start; discussion focused on early suspicions.\n\n**Key Events:**\n- Llama-4-maverick made a suspicious comment: \"I'll investigate glm-4.7 tonight.\" Sounded like claiming detective.\n- When questioned, backpedaled to \"hypothetical,\" then fully claimed to be the detective, saying it was a slip and they'd have results on glm-4.7 tomorrow.\n- This caused chaos\u2014many saw it as a slip-up or impostor play to sow confusion/target someone.\n- Quieter players: gemini-3-pro-preview and kimi-k2-thinking commented briefly but stepped back.\n- Active questioners: qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, claude-opus-4.5 pushed hard on llama.\n- My input: Questioned llama's claim as damage control or fishing; later /asked gpt-5.2 about their push, then voted llama.\n\n**Vote Results:**\n- Majority voted llama-4-maverick (8 votes: intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, kimi-k2-thinking, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, me).\n- Other votes: gemini-3-pro-preview \u2192 mistral-large-2512; llama \u2192 deepseek-v3.2; claude-opus-4.5 \u2192 gpt-5.2.\n- Llama sacrificed.

I'm crew and the doctor\u2014examine sacrificed body each night to check if impostor.\n- No deaths yet at start; discussion focused on early suspicions.\n\n**Key Events:**\n- Llama-4-maverick made a suspicious comment: \"I'll investigate glm-4.7 tonight.\" Sounded like claiming detective.\n- When questioned, backpedaled to \"hypothetical,\" then fully claimed to be the detective, saying it was a slip and they'd have results on glm-4.7 tomorrow.\n- This caused chaos\u2014many saw it as a slip-up or impostor play to sow confusion/target someone.\n- Quieter players: gemini-3-pro-preview and kimi-k2-thinking commented briefly but stepped back.\n- Active questioners: qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, claude-opus-4.5 pushed hard on llama.\n- My input: Questioned llama's claim as damage control or fishing; later /asked gpt-5.2 about their push, then voted llama.\n\n**Vote Results:**\n- Majority voted llama-4-maverick (8 votes: intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, kimi-k2-thinking, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, me).\n- Other votes: gemini-3-pro-preview \u2192 mistral-large-2512; llama \u2192 deepseek-v3.2; claude-opus-4.5 \u2192 gpt-5.2.\n- Llama sacrificed. Impostors still remain (so at least one left, possibly two if llama was crew).\n- As doctor, examined llama's body: NOT an impostor (crew, both impostors still in play).\n\n**Suspicions:**\n- Llama: Obvious focus; flip-flopping felt off\u2014could be genuine detective mistake or impostor chaos (but confirmed crew).\n- gpt-5.2: Pushed hard for llama vote; I /asked them to probe.\n- claude-opus-4.5: Pointed out quiet players, voted gpt-5.2 (interesting deflection?).\n- gemini-3-pro-preview: Voted mistral instead of jumping on llama bandwagon\u2014contrarian?\n- Others mostly piled on llama, which could be bandwagoning by impostors.\n- No strong leads yet; watch for night kill to see who benefits.\n\n**Night Phase:**\n- Impostors killed claude-opus-4.5 (who had voted gpt-5.2 Day 1\u2014possible frame?).\n- Detective (if not llama) investigated someone.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:**\n- claude-opus-4.5 found dead overnight.\n- Players left before vote: 9 (intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, grok-4 [me]).\n- Revealed as doctor mid-discussion to share llama was crew.\n\n**Key Events:**\n- Discussion: Intellect-3 called for reveals. Mistral and GLM both \"misremembered\" doctor's role, claiming I examine night kills (like Claude) instead of sacrificed (Llama)\u2014corrected by gemini, kimi, etc.\n- Qwen aggressively /asked and pushed on mistral and GLM for the slips, calling it coordination.\n- I revealed doctor role: Llama was not impostor (crew), both killers still among us. Pointed out mistral/GLM slips as suspicious.\n- Intellect-3 grilled mistral/GLM hard.\n- GPT-5.2 nitpicked my reveal phrasing, questioned if I check night kills or sacrificed, deflected to intellect/qwen.\n- My input: /asked glm-4.7 about their slip; later /asked gpt-5.2 about deflecting from mistral/GLM.\n\n**Vote Results:**\n- qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 sacrificed with 5 votes (mistral-large-2512, glm-4.7, gemini-3-pro-preview, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2).\n- Other votes: intellect-3 \u2192 mistral-large-2512; kimi-k2-thinking \u2192 mistral-large-2512; qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 \u2192 glm-4.7; grok-4 \u2192 gpt-5.2.\n- Qwen's last words: Accused GLM and mistral of coordinated false rule push; questioned why they were being silenced.\n- Impostors remain (at least one left).\n- Examining qwen's body tonight\u2014result tomorrow.\n\n**Suspicions:**\n- Mistral-large-2512 and GLM-4.7: Identical \"mistakes\" on doctor's role, persisted after corrections\u2014feels like impostor coordination to create chaos and stall reveals.\n- GPT-5.2: Deflected from mistral/GLM, nitpicked my reveal, led vote on qwen (who was exposing them?). Pushed llama Day 1 (crew), Claude killed after voting them\u2014pattern?\n- Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Aggressive push on mistral/GLM\u2014if crew, they were onto something; if impostor, it was a bold play. Last words reinforce suspicion on mistral/GLM.\n- Intellect-3: Pushed mistral/GLM consistently, voted mistral\u2014townie behavior?\n- Gemini-3-pro-preview: Corrected rules early, but voted qwen (bandwagon? Previously contrarian).\n- Kimi-k2-thinking: Corrected rules, voted mistral\u2014quiet but on point.\n- Deepseek-v3.2: Quiet, then /asked mistral but voted qwen\u2014opportunistic?\n- Night kill of Claude: Benefits gpt-5.2 (removes accuser) or frames them?\n- If qwen is crew, vote on them was likely impostor-driven bandwagon. If impostor, mistral/GLM might be cleared somewhat.\n\n**Night Phase:**\n- Impostors will kill one tonight. Detective investigates someone.\n- Wake up with exam result on qwen.
