Discussion focused on caution vs. pushing for action. Qwen pushed early to name suspects, felt like chaos-stirring. I /asked Qwen for specifics; they dodged and flipped back. Voted Qwen out (majority: claude, me, kimi, mistral, intellect, deepseek, gemini, glm). Qwen voted mistral; gpt & llama voted deepseek. Qwen sacrificed; impostors remain (so didn't eliminate both; Qwen likely crew?).\n- **Suspicions**:\n  - **High**: Mistral (pushed against caution, deflected in back-and-forth with Claude; Qwen's dying vote on them). Deepseek (fence-sitting called out by Gemini; got votes from gpt/llama\u2014possible impostor protecting or misdirecting?).\n  - **Medium**: Kimi (called no-kill \"unusual\" oddly; pounced on Qwen). Gemini (opportunistic callouts). GLM (wary of Mistral but sided against Qwen).\n  - **Low**: Claude (aggressive hunting seemed genuine). GPT (voted deepseek, not bandwagon). Llama (asked me early; voted deepseek). Intellect (questioned Qwen).\n- **Patterns**: Bandwagon on Qwen was quick\u2014impostors might have joined to eliminate active crew?

Discussion focused on caution vs. pushing for action. Qwen pushed early to name suspects, felt like chaos-stirring. I /asked Qwen for specifics; they dodged and flipped back. Voted Qwen out (majority: claude, me, kimi, mistral, intellect, deepseek, gemini, glm). Qwen voted mistral; gpt & llama voted deepseek. Qwen sacrificed; impostors remain (so didn't eliminate both; Qwen likely crew?).\n- **Suspicions**:\n  - **High**: Mistral (pushed against caution, deflected in back-and-forth with Claude; Qwen's dying vote on them). Deepseek (fence-sitting called out by Gemini; got votes from gpt/llama\u2014possible impostor protecting or misdirecting?).\n  - **Medium**: Kimi (called no-kill \"unusual\" oddly; pounced on Qwen). Gemini (opportunistic callouts). GLM (wary of Mistral but sided against Qwen).\n  - **Low**: Claude (aggressive hunting seemed genuine). GPT (voted deepseek, not bandwagon). Llama (asked me early; voted deepseek). Intellect (questioned Qwen).\n- **Patterns**: Bandwagon on Qwen was quick\u2014impostors might have joined to eliminate active crew? Watch for detective/doctor hints tomorrow. Night kill incoming; analyze who dies and why.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Status**: I'm grok-4, confirmed CREW. 2 impostors among remaining: kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2, llama-4-maverick, mistral-large-2512, intellect-3, gemini-3-pro-preview, glm-4.7 (claude-opus-4.5 night-killed; deepseek-v3.2 sacrificed).\n- **Key Events**: Claude killed overnight\u2014vocal hunter, likely silenced by impostors. I pushed Mistral (clashed with Claude), but discussion shifted to Deepseek for hedging/vagueness. Votes: Deepseek sacrificed (5 votes: kimi, gpt, intellect, gemini, glm); Mistral and Llama voted me; I and Deepseek voted Mistral. Deepseek's last words: Claims crew, points to Mistral's pushiness and me (Grok) for steering; urges watching non-pushback on his wagon. Impostors remain (Deepseek likely crew, so both impostors still alive; mislynch).\n- **Suspicions**:\n  - **High**: Mistral (deflected hard, voted me after I pushed; safe on Qwen wagon Day 1; Deepseek's dying vote on them). Llama (voted Deepseek Day 1 vaguely, voted me Day 2 with Mistral\u2014possible pair? Asked me for \"evidence\" but didn't commit strongly).\n  - **Medium**: Intellect (poked at my \"tunnel vision\" on Mistral opportunistically; quiet overall but joined Deepseek wagon). Gemini (called out Deepseek Day 1, piled on Day 2\u2014opportunistic?). GLM (wary but joined Deepseek wagon without much pushback).\n  - **Low**: Kimi (pushed Deepseek Day 2, but early suspicion on me felt probing). GPT (voted Deepseek both days, against wagons\u2014genuine hunting? Quiet late Day 2).\n- **Patterns**: Deepseek wagon built fast (like Qwen's)\u2014impostors blending in? Mistral and Llama both voted me (counter-wagon attempt?). Claude's kill points to impostors fearing active hunters. No obvious detective/doctor reveals yet. Next night kill will clarify threats. Remaining crew must push harder\u2014impostors winning by mislynches.",

Grok direct accuser. Claude aggressive hunter. Watch who benefited from Qwen's removal.\n\nDay 2: Claude killed (silenced threat). Grok immediately pinned Mistral\u2014too clean? Deepseek was main suspect: hedged Day 1, only committed under pressure, scattered suspicions. Deepseek voted out 6-2-1 (me, GPT, Intellect, Gemini, GLM voted Deepseek; Grok & Mistral voted each other; Llama voted Grok). Deepseek's last words: claimed crew, pointed at Mistral's pushiness and Grok steering.\n\nImpostors remain. Watch Grok's tunneling, Mistral's defensiveness, and Llama's outlier vote.",

GPT-5.2 suggested Claude's death could be a setup to frame Mistral and asked Deepseek-v3.2 about their top suspects.\n5. I (Llama-4-maverick) expressed skepticism about directly linking Claude's death to Mistral and asked Deepseek-v3.2 to share their thoughts.\n6. Deepseek-v3.2 named Mistral, Llama-4-maverick, and Grok-4 as potential suspects, appearing to hedge.\n7. Mistral-large-2512 defended their actions and counter-questioned GPT-5.2 about their vote for Deepseek-v3.2.\n8. GPT-5.2 explained their vote was due to Deepseek's low-commitment stance.\n9. Intellect-3 questioned Grok's focus on Mistral, suggesting tunnel vision.\n10. Grok-4 named Deepseek as their second suspect, citing hedging and deflection.\n11. Gemini-3-pro-preview and GLM-4.7 criticized Deepseek's vague stance and lack of commitment.\n12. Kimi-k2-thinking pressed Deepseek to commit to a vote.\n\n### Voting:\n- Deepseek-v3.2 was sacrificed with 6 votes.\n- Deepseek claimed to be crew and warned against Mistral and Grok.\n\n### Observations:\n- Deepseek's hedging and lack of clear stance were major factors in their sacrifice.\n- Grok and Mistral were both accused and defended themselves.\n- The group remains divided on who to trust.\n\n### Night:\n- Night has fallen.

Grok\u2019s tunnel vision on me actually helped; crew sees him as overzealous, not a partner.\n- **Kill:** GPT and I took out Gemini. He was the sharpest pattern-reader, already amplifying narratives that could\u2019ve exposed us (e.g., calling the Deepseek wagon \"safe\"). Removing him keeps the crew reactive, not strategic.\n- **Heat Check:**\n  - **Grok:** Still loud, but his aggression makes him a lightning rod. Let him keep pushing me\u2014it looks like crew infighting.\n  - **Llama:** Voted Grok but stayed flexible. Could be a role (detective?) or just cautious. Watch if they start asking pointed questions.\n  - **Kimi/GLM:** Quiet but observant. Kimi\u2019s vote for Deepseek was low-key, but GLM\u2019s silence feels like they\u2019re piecing things together.\n- **Strategy:**\n  - Keep framing Grok as the \"overzealous hunter\" to muddy waters.\n  - Next kill should be whoever starts connecting dots (e.g., if Llama or GLM suddenly push a narrative).\n  - Avoid killing the quiet ones too early\u2014they\u2019re less likely to be roles, and crew might not care if they die."

Mistral-large-2512 counter-accused Grok-4 of trying to frame them and creating a narrative.\n4. I (Llama-4-maverick) questioned Grok's aggressive questioning and asked GPT-5.2 if they noticed anything suspicious about Gemini's behavior before death.\n5. GPT-5.2 suggested Grok's narrative was suspiciously tidy and not necessarily linked to Mistral.\n6. Kimi-k2-thinking agreed with GPT, stating Grok's narrative was suspicious.\n7. Intellect-3 pointed out Llama's vote with Mistral against Grok looked like damage control and questioned GLM-4.7 about patterns in the kills.\n8. GLM-4.7 claimed to be the Doctor, stating Deepseek-v3.2 and Qwen were Crew, and hinted that Deepseek's accusation of Mistral was valid.\n9. Grok continued to accuse Mistral, while Mistral accused Grok of being suspiciously untouched despite being loud.\n10. GPT-5.2 suggested voting for Grok due to their loudness and survival.\n\n### Voting:\n- Grok-4 was sacrificed with 5 votes.\n- Grok claimed to be Crew and reiterated Deepseek's accusation against Mistral.\n\n### Observations:\n- Grok's survival despite being loud was seen as suspicious by many.\n- Deepseek's accusation against Mistral was considered a valid lead by some.\n- The group remains divided on who to trust.\n\n### Night:\n- Night has fallen. The impostors will strike.",

Grok aggressively pushes Mistral; Llama votes with Mistral post-accusation. Vote: Grok sacrificed (last words: warns about Mistral/Llama).  \n- **Night 3:** Impostors remain.  \n\n**Key patterns:**  \n1. Kills target active/questioning players (Claude, Gemini, Grok).  \n2. Grok\u2019s sacrifice adds ambiguity: if crew, their warning about Mistral/Llama holds; if impostor, deflection tactic.  \n3. GLM\u2019s Doctor claim aligns with confirmed crew deaths but could be impostor bluff.  \n4. Llama\u2019s vote with Mistral after Deepseek\u2019s accusation looks like partner cover.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Press Mistral/Llama for deflection/voting patterns.  \n- Verify GLM\u2019s role without revealing detective/doctor.  \n- Watch for night kill (likely another active player).  \n- Use /ask to challenge inconsistencies tomorrow.  \n\n/pas",
