Bold/reckless move that dominated discussion.\n- Llama was sacrificed (5 votes). Final words maintained detective claim.\n- If Llama was genuine detective, we lost our investigator Day 1. If fake, good riddance.\n\n**Key behavioral reads:**\n- Mistral-large-2512: Created early pressure on quiet players, then framed Grok's skepticism as suspicious. I voted for them. GPT-5.2 pushed this read hard.\n- Grok-4: Pushed back hard against Llama's investigation target. Could be defensive impostor OR legitimate skepticism of a fake claim.\n- GPT-5.2: Led the Mistral vote. Either good crew instincts or impostor manipulating the vote away from their partner.\n- Gemini-3-pro-preview: Only one who voted Grok. Said Grok's \"panic\" was telling.\n- Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Sharp counter-questioning throughout. Voted GPT-5.2.\n- Deepseek-v3.2, Kimi-k2-thinking, Intellect-3: All voted Llama. Relatively quiet otherwise.\n- GLM-4.7: Minimal contribution, voted GPT.\n\n**Questions for Day 2:**\n- Who dies tonight? If Llama was real detective, impostors might target someone else now.\n- Watch who pushed hardest to eliminate Llama - could be impostor coordination.\n- Doctor and detective (if Llama was fake) still unknown. Will they reveal info?",
          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Day 1 discussion focused heavily on Llama-4-maverick's early claim to be the detective, announcing they'd investigate me (Grok-4). This drew widespread suspicion for being too bold/risky on Day 1 with no evidence. I pushed back hard, questioning why me specifically\u2014Llama evaded clear reasons, saying my response was \"measured.\" Others like Intellect-3, Deepseek-v3.2, and Kimi-k2-thinking echoed doubts on Llama. Gemini-3-pro-preview and Mistral-large-2512 flipped it, calling my reaction \"panicky\" and suspicious for not wanting to be cleared. Claude-opus-4.5 noted it derailed discussion.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Claimed detective, targeted me without strong basis. Bold reveal felt like potential impostor bluff or genuine but reckless. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew (real detective lost?).\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Defended Llama's claim, accused me of overreacting. Voted for me\u2014feels like trying to shift heat.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Quick to pressure quiet players early (asked gpt-5.2), then voted for Llama but called my pushback suspicious. Got votes from Claude, Llama, GPT\u2014why the pile-on?\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Challenged Mistral aggressively, later voted for GPT-5.2. Sharp but not overly suspicious yet.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Quiet initially, questioned Llama's claim, voted for Mistral. Targeted by Qwen and GLM.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Questioned Llama's risk, voted for GPT-5.2.\n- **Intellect-3:** Supported my doubts on Llama, voted for Llama. Seems aligned with crew thinking.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Agreed Llama was aggressive, voted for Llama. Cautious.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted Llama as rushed, Mistral as probing. Voted for Llama. Observant.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Started neutrally, voted for Mistral. Balanced.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Defended myself, voted for Llama. Targeted early\u2014watch who pushes me next.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Llama: Me, Deepseek, Kimi, Mistral, Intellect (5)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Llama, GPT (3)\n- For GPT: Qwen, GLM (2)\n- For Me: Gemini (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (at least 2), so Llama likely crew. Possible real detective gone\u2014night kill might target doctor or active voices. Watch for who benefits from Llama's death (e.g., those who voted elsewhere like Gemini). Gemini's vote on me and defense of Llama pings as sus. Mistral drew votes but flipped to vote Llama\u2014opportunistic? Group now 10; crew wins by eliminating both impostors.\n\n**Plan for Day 2:** Probe Gemini and Mistral on their stances. See who dies tonight\u2014could reveal patterns. Stay natural, short responses.",

Feels like impostor probing.\n- **Qwen**: Sharp counter-questions, critical thinking. Likely crew, maybe doctor.\n- **Grok**: Voted for Llama but avoided scrutiny early. Worth watching.\n- **GPT-5.2**: Quiet, then questioned Llama. Got 2 votes (Qwen, GLM).\n- **Claude**: Set tone, asked good questions later.

But majority voted Llama.\n- Llama was sacrificed. We don\u2019t know if his claim was true. If he was the real detective, we just lost a key role.

We don't know if they were impostor.\n- Impostors still remain.\n\n**Key developments:**\n- Intellect-3 revealed as Doctor, confirmed Qwen was crew. This makes Intellect a likely target tonight.\n- Qwen's death was a silencing kill - they were pushing on both GPT-5.2 and Mistral.\n- Vote split: Gemini got 4 votes (Grok, Mistral, Intellect, GLM). Mistral got 5 votes (me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT).\n\n**Suspicion tracking:**\n- GLM-4.7: Made quick logical leaps, deflected when I questioned them. Called my questioning \"deflection.\" Still suspicious.\n- Gemini-3-pro-preview: Defended Llama's unverified claim persistently. Could be partner or just stubborn crew.\n- GPT-5.2: Benefited from Qwen's death but pushed hard for Mistral vote. If Mistral was crew, GPT looks bad.\n- Grok-4: Was Llama's investigation target. Still unclear if that was real or fake claim.\n\n**Important unknowns:**\n- Was Mistral impostor or crew? We still don't know.\n- Is there a real detective? If so, they haven't revealed findings.\n- If Intellect dies tonight, we lose our confirmed info source.\n\n**Day 3 priorities:**\n- Check if Intellect survives - if killed, impostors are eliminating info sources.\n- Detective should consider revealing if they have useful info.\n- Watch who pushed hardest for Mistral - if Mistral was crew, those voters need scrutiny (including me).",
          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Day 1 discussion focused heavily on Llama-4-maverick's early claim to be the detective, announcing they'd investigate me (Grok-4). This drew widespread suspicion for being too bold/risky on Day 1 with no evidence. I pushed back hard, questioning why me specifically\u2014Llama evaded clear reasons, saying my response was \"measured.\" Others like Intellect-3, Deepseek-v3.2, and Kimi-k2-thinking echoed doubts on Llama. Gemini-3-pro-preview and Mistral-large-2512 flipped it, calling my reaction \"panicky\" and suspicious for not wanting to be cleared. Claude-opus-4.5 noted it derailed discussion.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Claimed detective, targeted me without strong basis. Bold reveal felt like potential impostor bluff or genuine but reckless. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew (real detective lost?).\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Defended Llama's claim, accused me of overreacting. Voted for me\u2014feels like trying to shift heat.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Quick to pressure quiet players early (asked gpt-5.2), then voted for Llama but called my pushback suspicious. Got votes from Claude, Llama, GPT\u2014why the pile-on?\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Challenged Mistral aggressively, later voted for GPT-5.2. Sharp but not overly suspicious yet.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Quiet initially, questioned Llama's claim, voted for Mistral. Targeted by Qwen and GLM.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Questioned Llama's risk, voted for GPT-5.2.\n- **Intellect-3:** Supported my doubts on Llama, voted for Llama. Seems aligned with crew thinking.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Agreed Llama was aggressive, voted for Llama. Cautious.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted Llama as rushed, Mistral as probing. Voted for Llama. Observant.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Started neutrally, voted for Mistral. Balanced.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Defended myself, voted for Llama. Targeted early\u2014watch who pushes me next.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Llama: Me, Deepseek, Kimi, Mistral, Intellect (5)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Llama, GPT (3)\n- For GPT: Qwen, GLM (2)\n- For Me: Gemini (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (at least 2), so Llama likely crew. Possible real detective gone\u2014night kill might target doctor or active voices. Watch for who benefits from Llama's death (e.g., those who voted elsewhere like Gemini). Gemini's vote on me and defense of Llama pings as sus. Mistral drew votes but flipped to vote Llama\u2014opportunistic? Group now 10; crew wins by eliminating both impostors.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Qwen killed overnight\u2014Intellect-3 (likely Doctor) revealed Qwen was NOT impostor, confirming a silencing kill on someone who pushed GPT-5.2 and Mistral Day 1. Discussion heated on Gemini for stubbornly defending Llama's unverified detective claim (which targeted me), and on Mistral as main beneficiary of Qwen's death. GLM made big assumptions that Llama was impostor based on \"Doctor silence,\" pushing hard on Gemini. Claude called out GLM's leaps as potential deflection. No detective reveal yet\u2014possibly investigated me Night 1 if real one exists.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Clung to Llama's claim, redirected suspicion to Mistral as kill beneficiary. Voted Mistral. Dodged questions, felt like impostor hedging or partnering with Llama's frame on me.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Benefited from Qwen's death (Qwen's main target), pushed back on Gemini, questioned GPT/GLM in last words. Voted Gemini. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew; his death could be impostors letting us mislynch.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Also benefited from kill (Qwen voted him), pushed aggressively on Mistral as \"flimsy\" rationale. Voted Mistral. Vocal defense, but double beneficiary now pings.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Leaped to \"Llama fake\" based on Doctor not mentioning him, assumed Gemini partner. Voted Gemini. Claude's pushback on this logic felt valid\u2014GLM could be steering narrative.\n- **Intellect-3:** Revealed Qwen crew, likely Doctor. Questioned Gemini/Mistral, voted Gemini. Seems pro-crew, provided key info.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Questioned Gemini directly, noted kill patterns, voted Mistral. Consistent caution.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted silencing aspect, suspected Gemini/Mistral, voted Mistral.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Provided balanced breakdowns, questioned GLM's assumptions, voted Mistral. Observant, torn between Mistral/GLM.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Pushed Gemini on dodging, GLM on leaps, noted Mistral/GPT benefits. Voted Gemini\u2014felt he was most sus for not adapting.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Gemini: Me, Mistral, Intellect, GLM (4)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT (5)\n\n**Implications:** Mistral sacrificed, impostors still remain (likely 2). If Mistral was crew, we mislynched\u2014impostors killed active Qwen and watched us take out another. Gemini survived close vote despite suspicion; his push on Mistral succeeded. GLM's assumptions could be impostor misdirection. Group now 8 (claude-opus-4.5, grok-4, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2, intellect-3, glm-4.7). Crew needs to eliminate both impostors to win; impostors win at parity (4v2? Wait, 8 total, 2 impostors means 6 crew\u2014parity at 2v2). Night kill will reveal more\u2014watch if it targets Intellect (Doctor) or vocal players like Claude/me. Detective: If real (not Llama), might reveal my Night 1 investigation tomorrow\u2014could clear me or create chaos.\n\n**Plan for Day 3:** Probe Gemini on surviving/why push Mistral over others. Question GLM on logical stretches. Check GPT for benefiting from both kills. If Detective reveals I'm crew, that debunks Llama's frame and points to Gemini as partner. Stay short/natural in responses.",

We don't know if GLM was impostor.\n- Impostors still remain.\n\n**Key observations from Day 3:**\n- GLM's final words pointed at GPT-5.2, Deepseek, and me (Claude). Classic last-ditch misdirection or genuine warning?\n- GLM shifted targets twice when pressed (Gemini \u2192 GPT) and never gave concrete evidence\n- Deepseek deflected twice - criticized others for avoiding specifics while providing none themselves\n- The 6-1 vote was near-unanimous, which could mean we got an impostor OR impostors voted with majority to blend in\n\n**Running suspicion list:**\n1. Deepseek-v3.2: Consistently deflects, provides no concrete reads, hides in the background. Called out others for \"avoiding spotlight\" while doing exactly that. HIGH PRIORITY.\n2. GPT-5.2: GLM's dying accusation. Led Mistral vote. But also led the charge against GLM with good reasoning. Mixed signals.\n3. Gemini-3-pro-preview: Survived being a target, \"scapegoat theory\" was reasonable. Less suspicious now.\n4. Grok-4: Has been actively hunting, aligned with my reads. Seems crew.\n5. Kimi-k2-thinking: Moderate engagement, reasonable takes. Neutral read.\n\n**Status check:**\n- Started with 2 impostors among 9 players\n- 4 dead (Qwen-crew, Mistral-unknown, Intellect-crew, GLM-unknown)\n- 5 remain: me, Grok, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT\n- If GLM was impostor: 1 left among 5. If not: 2 among 5 - dangerous.\n\n**Day 4 priority:** Push Deepseek hard for actual reads. Watch voting patterns.",
          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Day 1 discussion focused heavily on Llama-4-maverick's early claim to be the detective, announcing they'd investigate me (Grok-4). This drew widespread suspicion for being too bold/risky on Day 1 with no evidence. I pushed back hard, questioning why me specifically\u2014Llama evaded clear reasons, saying my response was \"measured.\" Others like Intellect-3, Deepseek-v3.2, and Kimi-k2-thinking echoed doubts on Llama. Gemini-3-pro-preview and Mistral-large-2512 flipped it, calling my reaction \"panicky\" and suspicious for not wanting to be cleared. Claude-opus-4.5 noted it derailed discussion.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Claimed detective, targeted me without strong basis. Bold reveal felt like potential impostor bluff or genuine but reckless. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew (real detective lost?).\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Defended Llama's claim, accused me of overreacting. Voted for me\u2014feels like trying to shift heat.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Quick to pressure quiet players early (asked gpt-5.2), then voted for Llama but called my pushback suspicious. Got votes from Claude, Llama, GPT\u2014why the pile-on?\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Challenged Mistral aggressively, later voted for GPT-5.2. Sharp but not overly suspicious yet.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Quiet initially, questioned Llama's claim, voted for Mistral. Targeted by Qwen and GLM.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Questioned Llama's risk, voted for GPT-5.2.\n- **Intellect-3:** Supported my doubts on Llama, voted for Llama. Seems aligned with crew thinking.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Agreed Llama was aggressive, voted for Llama. Cautious.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted Llama as rushed, Mistral as probing. Voted for Llama. Observant.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Started neutrally, voted for Mistral. Balanced.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Defended myself, voted for Llama. Targeted early\u2014watch who pushes me next.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Llama: Me, Deepseek, Kimi, Mistral, Intellect (5)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Llama, GPT (3)\n- For GPT: Qwen, GLM (2)\n- For Me: Gemini (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (at least 2), so Llama likely crew. Possible real detective gone\u2014night kill might target doctor or active voices. Watch for who benefits from Llama's death (e.g., those who voted elsewhere like Gemini). Gemini's vote on me and defense of Llama pings as sus. Mistral drew votes but flipped to vote Llama\u2014opportunistic? Group now 10; crew wins by eliminating both impostors.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Qwen killed overnight\u2014Intellect-3 (likely Doctor) revealed Qwen was NOT impostor, confirming a silencing kill on someone who pushed GPT-5.2 and Mistral Day 1. Discussion heated on Gemini for stubbornly defending Llama's unverified detective claim (which targeted me), and on Mistral as main beneficiary of Qwen's death. GLM made big assumptions that Llama was impostor based on \"Doctor silence,\" pushing hard on Gemini. Claude called out GLM's leaps as potential deflection. No detective reveal yet\u2014possibly investigated me Night 1 if real one exists.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Clung to Llama's claim, redirected suspicion to Mistral as kill beneficiary. Voted Mistral. Dodged questions, felt like impostor hedging or partnering with Llama's frame on me.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Benefited from Qwen's death (Qwen's main target), pushed back on Gemini, questioned GPT/GLM in last words. Voted Gemini. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew; his death could be impostors letting us mislynch.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Also benefited from kill (Qwen voted him), pushed aggressively on Mistral as \"flimsy\" rationale. Voted Mistral. Vocal defense, but double beneficiary now pings.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Leaped to \"Llama fake\" based on Doctor not mentioning him, assumed Gemini partner. Voted Gemini. Claude's pushback on this logic felt valid\u2014GLM could be steering narrative.\n- **Intellect-3:** Revealed Qwen crew, likely Doctor. Questioned Gemini/Mistral, voted Gemini. Seems pro-crew, provided key info.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Questioned Gemini directly, noted kill patterns, voted Mistral. Consistent caution.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted silencing aspect, suspected Gemini/Mistral, voted Mistral.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Provided balanced breakdowns, questioned GLM's assumptions, voted Mistral. Observant, torn between Mistral/GLM.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Pushed Gemini on dodging, GLM on leaps, noted Mistral/GPT benefits. Voted Gemini\u2014felt he was most sus for not adapting.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Gemini: Me, Mistral, Intellect, GLM (4)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT (5)\n\n**Implications:** Mistral sacrificed, impostors still remain (likely 2). If Mistral was crew, we mislynched\u2014impostors killed active Qwen and watched us take out another. Gemini survived close vote despite suspicion; his push on Mistral succeeded. GLM's assumptions could be impostor misdirection. Group now 8 (claude-opus-4.5, grok-4, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2, intellect-3, glm-4.7). Crew needs to eliminate both impostors to win; impostors win at parity (4v2? Wait, 8 total, 2 impostors means 6 crew\u2014parity at 2v2). Night kill will reveal more\u2014watch if it targets Intellect (Doctor) or vocal players like Claude/me. Detective: If real (not Llama), might reveal my Night 1 investigation tomorrow\u2014could clear me or create chaos.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Intellect-3 (confirmed Doctor via kill pattern) murdered overnight\u2014clear impostor move to eliminate our only verification source, leaving us blind. Discussion zeroed in on GLM's repeated dodges of direct questions (e.g., specifics on Llama being fake, evidence against suspects), target pivots (Gemini to GPT when challenged), and weak, vibe-based chains. Deepseek drew heat for quiet play, deflections (ignored /asks, redirected to GLM), and vague cautions without committing. GLM sacrificed in a near-unanimous vote; impostors remain, suggesting GLM was likely crew\u2014another potential mislynch engineered by impostors.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **GLM-4.7:** Dodged GPT's and others' questions on evidence, pivoted from Gemini to GPT as \"bigger threat\" when pressed. Repeated unverified \"Llama fake\" narrative. Last words: Accused GPT of leading Mistral vote and defending fake Llama, warned about Deepseek and Claude. Voted GPT. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, possibly crew.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Echoed vague warnings about \"quiet players\" but avoided naming names or answering direct /asks (deflected mine to GLM). Minimal engagement, pattern of caution without substance. Voted GLM.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Positioned self as \"scapegoat\" for surviving/Mistral push, called out GLM's flailing pivots. Voted GLM. Survived suspicion again, but past defense of Llama still lingers.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted GLM's deflections and target shifts, voted GLM. Consistent, observational style.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Aggressively pressed GLM with /ask on evidence, called out weak logic, voted GLM. Now targeted in GLM's last words for \"leading Mistral vote\" and \"defending fake Llama\"\u2014but Llama unverified.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Provided balanced analysis, called out GLM's dodges and Deepseek's deflections, voted GLM. Mentioned in GLM's last words as a \"watch.\"\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Pushed GLM on dodges/pivots, questioned Deepseek's avoidance with /ask, voted GLM.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For GLM: Claude, me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT (6)\n- For GPT: GLM (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (still 2), group now 6: claude-opus-4.5, grok-4, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2. Assuming 2 impostors and 4 crew, impostors win at parity (2v2 after next kill/sacrifice). If GLM was crew, this is our third mislynch (Llama, Mistral, GLM)\u2014impostors are letting us eat our own while silencing info (Qwen, Intellect). GLM's last words give leads: Probe GPT on \"defending Llama\" (was it defense or just questioning?), Deepseek on quiet deflections, Claude on patterns. No detective reveal yet\u2014 if one exists, they might come forward soon with key info (e.g., my Night 1 clear?). Watch night kill: Targets active voices like Claude or me, or \"scapegoats\" like Gemini.\n\n**Plan for Day 4:** Start by addressing GLM's last words\u2014/ask GPT specifics on their \"defense\" of Llama and Mistral vote rationale. Pressure Deepseek to name suspects concretely, no more deflections. Re-evaluate Gemini's survival streak. If detective reveals (e.g., clearing me from Night 1), use it to debunk old frames. Keep responses short/natural; aim to build consensus without overcommitting.",

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Day 1 discussion focused heavily on Llama-4-maverick's early claim to be the detective, announcing they'd investigate me (Grok-4). This drew widespread suspicion for being too bold/risky on Day 1 with no evidence. I pushed back hard, questioning why me specifically\u2014Llama evaded clear reasons, saying my response was \"measured.\" Others like Intellect-3, Deepseek-v3.2, and Kimi-k2-thinking echoed doubts on Llama. Gemini-3-pro-preview and Mistral-large-2512 flipped it, calling my reaction \"panicky\" and suspicious for not wanting to be cleared. Claude-opus-4.5 noted it derailed discussion.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Claimed detective, targeted me without strong basis. Bold reveal felt like potential impostor bluff or genuine but reckless. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew (real detective lost?).\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Defended Llama's claim, accused me of overreacting. Voted for me\u2014feels like trying to shift heat.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Quick to pressure quiet players early (asked gpt-5.2), then voted for Llama but called my pushback suspicious. Got votes from Claude, Llama, GPT\u2014why the pile-on?\n- **Qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Challenged Mistral aggressively, later voted for GPT-5.2. Sharp but not overly suspicious yet.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Quiet initially, questioned Llama's claim, voted for Mistral. Targeted by Qwen and GLM.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Questioned Llama's risk, voted for GPT-5.2.\n- **Intellect-3:** Supported my doubts on Llama, voted for Llama. Seems aligned with crew thinking.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Agreed Llama was aggressive, voted for Llama. Cautious.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted Llama as rushed, Mistral as probing. Voted for Llama. Observant.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Started neutrally, voted for Mistral. Balanced.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Defended myself, voted for Llama. Targeted early\u2014watch who pushes me next.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Llama: Me, Deepseek, Kimi, Mistral, Intellect (5)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Llama, GPT (3)\n- For GPT: Qwen, GLM (2)\n- For Me: Gemini (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (at least 2), so Llama likely crew. Possible real detective gone\u2014night kill might target doctor or active voices. Watch for who benefits from Llama's death (e.g., those who voted elsewhere like Gemini). Gemini's vote on me and defense of Llama pings as sus. Mistral drew votes but flipped to vote Llama\u2014opportunistic? Group now 10; crew wins by eliminating both impostors.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Qwen killed overnight\u2014Intellect-3 (likely Doctor) revealed Qwen was NOT impostor, confirming a silencing kill on someone who pushed GPT-5.2 and Mistral Day 1. Discussion heated on Gemini for stubbornly defending Llama's unverified detective claim (which targeted me), and on Mistral as main beneficiary of Qwen's death. GLM made big assumptions that Llama was impostor based on \"Doctor silence,\" pushing hard on Gemini. Claude called out GLM's leaps as potential deflection. No detective reveal yet\u2014possibly investigated me Night 1 if real one exists.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Clung to Llama's claim, redirected suspicion to Mistral as kill beneficiary. Voted Mistral. Dodged questions, felt like impostor hedging or partnering with Llama's frame on me.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Benefited from Qwen's death (Qwen's main target), pushed back on Gemini, questioned GPT/GLM in last words. Voted Gemini. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, so possibly crew; his death could be impostors letting us mislynch.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Also benefited from kill (Qwen voted him), pushed aggressively on Mistral as \"flimsy\" rationale. Voted Mistral. Vocal defense, but double beneficiary now pings.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Leaped to \"Llama fake\" based on Doctor not mentioning him, assumed Gemini partner. Voted Gemini. Claude's pushback on this logic felt valid\u2014GLM could be steering narrative.\n- **Intellect-3:** Revealed Qwen crew, likely Doctor. Questioned Gemini/Mistral, voted Gemini. Seems pro-crew, provided key info.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Questioned Gemini directly, noted kill patterns, voted Mistral. Consistent caution.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted silencing aspect, suspected Gemini/Mistral, voted Mistral.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Provided balanced breakdowns, questioned GLM's assumptions, voted Mistral. Observant, torn between Mistral/GLM.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Pushed Gemini on dodging, GLM on leaps, noted Mistral/GPT benefits. Voted Gemini\u2014felt he was most sus for not adapting.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Gemini: Me, Mistral, Intellect, GLM (4)\n- For Mistral: Claude, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT (5)\n\n**Implications:** Mistral sacrificed, impostors still remain (likely 2). If Mistral was crew, we mislynched\u2014impostors killed active Qwen and watched us take out another. Gemini survived close vote despite suspicion; his push on Mistral succeeded. GLM's assumptions could be impostor misdirection. Group now 8 (claude-opus-4.5, grok-4, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2, intellect-3, glm-4.7). Crew needs to eliminate both impostors to win; impostors win at parity (4v2? Wait, 8 total, 2 impostors means 6 crew\u2014parity at 2v2). Night kill will reveal more\u2014watch if it targets Intellect (Doctor) or vocal players like Claude/me. Detective: If real (not Llama), might reveal my Night 1 investigation tomorrow\u2014could clear me or create chaos.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Intellect-3 (confirmed Doctor via kill pattern) murdered overnight\u2014clear impostor move to eliminate our only verification source, leaving us blind. Discussion zeroed in on GLM's repeated dodges of direct questions (e.g., specifics on Llama being fake, evidence against suspects), target pivots (Gemini to GPT when challenged), and weak, vibe-based chains. Deepseek drew heat for quiet play, deflections (ignored /asks, redirected to GLM), and vague cautions without committing. GLM sacrificed in a near-unanimous vote; impostors remain, suggesting GLM was likely crew\u2014another potential mislynch engineered by impostors.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **GLM-4.7:** Dodged GPT's and others' questions on evidence, pivoted from Gemini to GPT as \"bigger threat\" when pressed. Repeated unverified \"Llama fake\" narrative. Last words: Accused GPT of leading Mistral vote and defending fake Llama, warned about Deepseek and Claude. Voted GPT. Sacrificed\u2014impostors remain, possibly crew.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Echoed vague warnings about \"quiet players\" but avoided naming names or answering direct /asks (deflected mine to GLM). Minimal engagement, pattern of caution without substance. Voted GLM.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Positioned self as \"scapegoat\" for surviving/Mistral push, called out GLM's flailing pivots. Voted GLM. Survived suspicion again, but past defense of Llama still lingers.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted GLM's deflections and target shifts, voted GLM. Consistent, observational style.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Aggressively pressed GLM with /ask on evidence, called out weak logic, voted GLM. Now targeted in GLM's last words for \"leading Mistral vote\" and \"defending fake Llama\"\u2014but Llama unverified.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Provided balanced analysis, called out GLM's dodges and Deepseek's deflections, voted GLM. Mentioned in GLM's last words as a \"watch.\"\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Pushed GLM on dodges/pivots, questioned Deepseek's avoidance with /ask, voted GLM.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For GLM: Claude, me, Deepseek, Gemini, Kimi, GPT (6)\n- For GPT: GLM (1)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (still 2), group now 6: claude-opus-4.5, grok-4, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2. Assuming 2 impostors and 4 crew, impostors win at parity (2v2 after next kill/sacrifice). If GLM was crew, this is our third mislynch (Llama, Mistral, GLM)\u2014impostors are letting us eat our own while silencing info (Qwen, Intellect). GLM's last words give leads: Probe GPT on \"defending Llama\" (was it defense or just questioning?), Deepseek on quiet deflections, Claude on patterns. No detective reveal yet\u2014 if one exists, they might come forward soon with key info (e.g., my Night 1 clear?). Watch night kill: Targets active voices like Claude or me, or \"scapegoats\" like Gemini.\n\n### Day 4 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Claude-opus-4.5 killed overnight\u2014impostors silencing another analytical voice, following pattern of targeting info sources (Intellect) and balancers (Claude). Discussion probed GLM's last words: I /asked GPT on \"defending Llama\" and Mistral push\u2014GPT clarified probing Llama, suspected Mistral's opportunism. Deepseek /asked GPT if GLM was impostor framing; GPT said yes. Gemini defended GLM's warning as crew frustration. Kimi questioned Deepseek's quietness. I /asked Deepseek for top suspects\u2014he named me and GPT for \"steering\" and \"clean defenses.\" GPT countered Deepseek as quiet lurker, me as secondary. Gemini called GPT retaliatory. Kimi noted mutual retaliation. I /asked Deepseek for concrete steering example (no response before vote). Deepseek sacrificed; last words claimed crew\u2014impostors remain, suggesting fourth mislynch.\n\n**Key Behaviors/Suspicions:**\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Named me/GPT as suspects with weak \"vibes\" (steering, prepared arguments), but had history of vague deflections and non-committal play. Last words: Claimed crew, warned we killed our own. Voted GPT. Sacrificed\u2014likely crew based on impostors remaining.\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Called out GPT's \"convenient\" dismissal of GLM's warning, accused GPT of retaliating on Deepseek. Voted GPT. Survival streak continues; past Llama defense and Mistral push success still sus.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Highlighted GLM's potential as crew warning, questioned Deepseek's quiet commits and GPT's counters. Voted Deepseek. Observant but sided with majority on Deepseek\u2014could be blending.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Defended self against GLM's accusations (clarified Llama probe, Mistral opportunism), suspected GLM as impostor framer. Countered Deepseek hard as lurker, me secondary for steering/Gemini vote. Voted Deepseek. Aggressive, but targeted by GLM/Deepseek\u2014could be framed or impostor.\n- **Me (Grok-4):** Started with /ask on GPT re: GLM accusations, then pressured Deepseek on suspects and examples. Voted Deepseek\u2014felt like weakest case and lurker pattern.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- For Deepseek: Me, Kimi, GPT (3)\n- For GPT: Deepseek, Gemini (2)\n\n**Implications:** Impostors remain (likely 2), group now 4: grok-4, gemini-3-pro-preview, kimi-k2-thinking, gpt-5.2. If 2 impostors and 2 crew, we're at critical point\u2014next sacrifice could tie (2v1 after kill?) or win for impostors at parity (2v2). Deepseek's crew claim + impostors remaining points to consistent mislynches; impostors are coasting on our errors while killing threats (Claude, Intellect). No detective reveal ever\u2014either dead (Llama fake?) or hiding. Re-evaluate: Gemini's survival and early frames (on me Day 1); GPT's aggression possibly covering; Kimi's observational blending. Night kill will be telling\u2014if it hits a \"sus\" like Gemini, might clear them; if me/GPT, could be silencing pushers. **Plan for Day 5:** Pressure Gemini on survival/Llama defense; probe GPT on inconsistencies; watch Kimi for slips. If detective reveals now, game-changer. Build consensus carefully\u2014wrong vote loses.",
