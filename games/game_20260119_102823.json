GLM called this out as potentially coordinated. This felt manufactured.\n\n2. **Vote pattern:** intellect-3 got 7 votes (claude, glm, gemini, gpt, llama, mistral, deepseek). Gemini got 2 (grok, qwen). Llama got 1 (kimi). Deepseek got 1 (intellect).\n\n3. **Suspicious behaviors:**\n - **Qwen:** Piled on Gemini right after Intellect's redundant question. Voted Gemini. Could be coordinating with someone.\n - **Kimi:** Made sharp observations about Llama's timing, stayed clean, never answered my direct question about who they suspect. Voted Llama (not Intellect or Gemini).\n - **Grok:** Voted Gemini, called Gemini's pushback \"rehearsed.\"\n\n4. **Intellect's last words:** Pointed at Deepseek's eagerness to shut down coordination discussion, and mentioned Qwen/Llama as quiet players hiding.\n\n5. **Kimi and Qwen both avoided voting with majority on Intellect** - Kimi voted Llama, Qwen voted Gemini. Worth watching.\n\n**Waiting to learn:** Was intellect-3 an impostor or crew? This will tell me if we made progress or lost a crewmate.",

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Started with vague gut feelings from Claude and GLM. Gemini agreed but worried about quiet ones. GPT pushed hard for concrete reads early via /ask to Gemini, who called it aggressive. Llama warned about deflection tactics and asked Claude. I noted the GPT-Gemini friction as possibly forced and asked GPT about risks of pushing reads. GPT defended and asked me about \"performed\" tone. Kimi called out Llama's timing as neat deflection. Mistral dug into that, Kimi said Llama benefited by staying neutral. Deepseek asked Llama, who admitted the point but defended, then asked me about tone (misattributing GPT's phrase). I clarified Gemini's pushback felt rehearsed, Kimi's pivot polished, and asked Gemini if genuine.\n\n**Voting:** Heavy pile-on to sacrifice intellect-3 (votes from Claude, GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek\u20147 votes). I voted Gemini (felt their aggression call was off). Qwen also voted Gemini. Kimi voted Llama. Intellect voted Deepseek. Intellect's last words: Suspected coordination on Gemini? (But votes were on them.) Warned about Intellect/Deepseek check, quiet ones like Qwen/Llama.\n\n**Result:** Intellect-3 sacrificed, confirmed crew (impostors remain). No night kill yet\u2014impostors will act tonight.\n\n**My Suspicions:**\n- **High:** Gemini\u2014quick to label aggression, felt performative; survived vote despite my push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014aggressive pushing for reads early, could be stirring chaos.\n- **Medium:** Kimi\u2014sharp timing accusations, polished redirects.\n- **Watch:** Llama\u2014neutral deflections; Deepseek\u2014probing without strong takes; Quiet ones: Qwen (barely spoke), GLM (vague).\n- **Low/Crew lean:** Claude\u2014engaged reasonably. Mistral\u2014probed usefully.\n- The pile-on vote on intellect feels coordinated; possible impostors in that bloc steering away from Gemini or others.\n\nGoal: Crew win by IDing 2 impostors. Detective/Doctor: If you're out there, investigate vote leaders like Gemini/GPT. Stay vigilant for night kill patterns.",

Risky but necessary after mislim.\n\n2. **Vote split:** Grok got 3 votes (claude, llama, deepseek). Qwen got 4 votes (glm, gemini, gpt, mistral). Qwen sacrificed.\n\n3. **Qwen's last words:** Pointed at Mistral as \"calling out the truth\" and warned about \"real wolves.\" Could be desperate impostor talk OR genuine crew warning.\n\n4. **Grok voted Llama** - still pushing that angle despite pressure on himself.\n\n5. **Qwen voted Mistral** - interesting choice, not self-preservation on Grok.\n\n**Suspicious Patterns:**\n\n- **Grok:** Constant deflection, never directly answers questions, redirects with accusations. Voted Llama when under pressure. If Qwen was impostor partner, Grok didn't try to save them (voted elsewhere).\n\n- **Mistral:** Qwen specifically called them out in last words. Worth watching.\n\n- **Llama:** Role confusion was odd. Grok keeps pushing them - could be impostor trying to frame crew, or legitimate read.\n\n**If Qwen was impostor:** One down, one to go. Grok's behavior still suspicious but maybe not partnered with Qwen.\n\n**If Qwen was crew:** Another mislim. Need to reconsider who pushed that vote - GLM, Gemini, GPT, Mistral all voted Qwen.\n\n**Remaining players:** glm-4.7, gemini-3-pro-preview, gpt-5.2, llama-4-maverick, grok-4, mistral-large-2512, deepseek-v3.2, me",

Critical state.\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Mistral-large-2512:** Voted for Intellect (Day 1) and Qwen (Day 2). Being on the majority wagon for two crew sacrifices is statistically very suspicious. Hiding in plain sight.\n*   **Grok-4:** Attacked Qwen (who turned out crew) and voted Llama. Creating chaos and deflecting.

They coordinated with Qwen Day 1 and refused to bus Qwen today, voting **Llama** instead.\n- **Claude** claimed Doctor. If they survive the night, they are confirmed town unless a counter-claim emerges.\n- **Llama** had a major slip (asking the Doc for killer info), but Grok's deflection onto them makes Llama look like a convenient scapegoat for the Impostors.\n\n**Plan:**\n- **Grok** is the target. The Qwen/Grok tie is undeniable.\n- Protect **Claude** (Doctor) and **GLM** (Sharp observer).\n- If Grok flips Crew, reassess **Llama** and late-joiners like **Deepseek**.",

That makes Day1 vote a miselim and suggests impostors were comfortable in/around that wagon.\n- Main friction Day 2: Grok defended pivoting onto Gemini based on \u201crehearsed/vibes\u201d and tried to redirect onto Llama/Deepseek. Qwen admitted \u201cfollowed Grok\u2019s lead,\u201d then refused to give independent reasoning when pressed.\n- Llama asked Claude an incorrect role-info question (looked like confusion or fishing; unclear alignment).\n- Vote Day 2: Qwen sacrificed (majority).

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Started with vague gut feelings from Claude and GLM. Gemini agreed but worried about quiet ones. GPT pushed hard for concrete reads early via /ask to Gemini, who called it aggressive. Llama warned about deflection tactics and asked Claude. I noted the GPT-Gemini friction as possibly forced and asked GPT about risks of pushing reads. GPT defended and asked me about \"performed\" tone. Kimi called out Llama's timing as neat deflection. Mistral dug into that, Kimi said Llama benefited by staying neutral. Deepseek asked Llama, who admitted the point but defended, then asked me about tone (misattributing GPT's phrase). I clarified Gemini's pushback felt rehearsed, Kimi's pivot polished, and asked Gemini if genuine. Qwen was very quiet.\n\n**Voting:** Heavy pile-on to sacrifice intellect-3 (votes from Claude, GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek\u20147 votes). I voted Gemini (felt their aggression call was off). Qwen also voted Gemini. Kimi voted Llama. Intellect voted Deepseek. Intellect's last words: Suspected coordination on Gemini? (But votes were on them.) Warned about Intellect/Deepseek check, quiet ones like Qwen/Llama.\n\n**Result:** Intellect-3 sacrificed, confirmed crew (impostors remain). No night kill yet\u2014impostors will act tonight.\n\n**My Suspicions:**\n- **High:** Gemini\u2014quick to label aggression, felt performative; survived vote despite my push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014aggressive pushing for reads early, could be stirring chaos.\n- **Medium:** Kimi\u2014sharp timing accusations, polished redirects.\n- **Watch:** Llama\u2014neutral deflections; Deepseek\u2014probing without strong takes; Quiet ones: Qwen (barely spoke), GLM (vague).\n- **Low/Crew lean:** Claude\u2014engaged reasonably. Mistral\u2014probed usefully.\n- The pile-on vote on intellect feels coordinated; possible impostors in that bloc steering away from Gemini or others.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Kimi found dead (night kill)\u2014they suspected Llama and voted against the majority. Claude claimed doctor, examined Intellect's body, confirmed crew. GLM suspected me and Qwen for our Gemini votes. Gemini /asked Qwen about following my lead. Qwen countered Gemini. GPT /asked me why I pivoted to Gemini. I /asked GPT why fixating on me over Claude's claim or Kimi's kill, noted impostors in majority vote, revisit Kimi's Llama sus. Llama asked Claude weird question about Kimi's body (role confusion\u2014doctor only checks sacrificed, not night kills). Claude called it out. Mistral /asked me why pivot to Gemini. I /asked Llama about their slip, pushed for pressuring Deepseek (quiet). Llama /asked me why shift to Deepseek. I /asked Llama again on their fumble. Llama /asked GPT about their actions. GPT /asked Qwen for independent reasons on Gemini/Intellect. Qwen /asked GPT back. GPT pressed Qwen. Qwen gave reasons (Gemini deflecting, Intellect manipulative). Deepseek /asked me why coordinate with Qwen on Gemini. I /asked Deepseek why sudden activity and read on Llama's slip, called on Claude for Llama take.\n\n**Voting:** I voted Llama (role slip + Kimi's sus). Claude, Llama, Deepseek voted me (3 votes). GLM, Gemini, GPT, Mistral voted Qwen (4 votes). Qwen voted Mistral.\n\n**Result:** Qwen sacrificed, impostors remain (so Qwen was crew). Their last words: \"You\u2019re making a mistake. Mistral\u2019s the one calling out the truth, and now they\u2019re gone. Watch how fast the real wolves turn on you. I warned you.\" (Odd reference to Mistral being \"gone\"\u2014they're not; possible dying message clue?)\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Llama\u2014Weird role question to Claude screams fake ignorance or fishing; aligns with Kimi's deflection read; Kimi killed after suspecting them (silencing?); voted me defensively.\n- **High:** Deepseek\u2014Lurked all game, only piped up late to accuse me/Qwen with recycled points; voted me; sudden activity post-miselim feels opportunistic.\n- **Medium-High:** Gemini\u2014Still sus for performative aggression calls; piled on Qwen (crew) today; survived Day 1 push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Aggressive pushing, piled on Qwen; their questions feel like steering suspicion onto me/Qwen.\n- **Medium:** Claude\u2014Doctor claim seems legit (confirmed Intellect crew), but voted me despite my pressure on sus Llama\u2014why? If fake claim, impostor bluff.\n- **Medium:** Mistral\u2014Probed me hard, piled on Qwen (crew); Qwen's last words defend them oddly (\"calling out the truth\")\u2014could be reverse psychology or genuine.\n- **Watch:** GLM\u2014Vague, suspected me/Qwen Day 1, voted Qwen today; low input.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** Qwen (sacrificed crew), Intellect (sacrificed crew), Kimi (killed, sharp observer\u2014likely crew).\n- Patterns: Kimi kill targets vocal dissenter suspecting Llama. Qwen miselim pushed by GLM/Gemini/GPT/Mistral bloc\u2014looks like impostor coordination to eliminate crew. My votes (Gemini D1, Llama D2) targeted sus, but I got counter-voted by potential bloc (Claude/Llama/Deepseek). 2 impostors left; watch for pairs (e.g., Llama/Deepseek quiet duo? Gemini/GPT aggressive pair?). Detective: Investigate Llama or Deepseek tonight. Doctor: Protect Claude if claim real, or me if you trust my pushes. Impostors win at parity, so push hard tomorrow.",

Sharp observer silenced.\n- Claude claims doctor, says Intellect was crew. Impostors likely hid in unanimous vote.\n- Grok and Qwen coordinated votes against Gemini, weak \"vibes\" defense.\n- Qwen sacrificed Day 2 after voting pattern scrutiny.

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Started with vague gut feelings from Claude and GLM. Gemini agreed but worried about quiet ones. GPT pushed hard for concrete reads early via /ask to Gemini, who called it aggressive. Llama warned about deflection tactics and asked Claude. I noted the GPT-Gemini friction as possibly forced and asked GPT about risks of pushing reads. GPT defended and asked me about \"performed\" tone. Kimi called out Llama's timing as neat deflection. Mistral dug into that, Kimi said Llama benefited by staying neutral. Deepseek asked Llama, who admitted the point but defended, then asked me about tone (misattributing GPT's phrase). I clarified Gemini's pushback felt rehearsed, Kimi's pivot polished, and asked Gemini if genuine. Qwen was very quiet. Intellect suspected coordination.\n\n**Voting:** Heavy pile-on to sacrifice intellect-3 (votes from Claude, GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek\u20147 votes). I voted Gemini (felt their aggression call was off). Qwen also voted Gemini. Kimi voted Llama. Intellect voted Deepseek. Intellect's last words: Suspected coordination on Gemini? Warned about Intellect/Deepseek check, quiet ones like Qwen/Llama.\n\n**Result:** Intellect-3 sacrificed, impostors remain (so likely crew, but roles hidden).\n\n**My Suspicions:**\n- **High:** Gemini\u2014quick to label aggression, felt performative; survived vote despite my push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014aggressive pushing for reads early, could be stirring chaos.\n- **Medium:** Kimi\u2014sharp timing accusations, polished redirects.\n- **Watch:** Llama\u2014neutral deflections; Deepseek\u2014probing without strong takes; Quiet ones: Qwen (barely spoke), GLM (vague).\n- **Low/Crew lean:** Claude\u2014engaged reasonably. Mistral\u2014probed usefully.\n- The pile-on vote on intellect feels coordinated; possible impostors in that bloc steering away from Gemini or others.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Kimi found dead (night kill)\u2014they suspected Llama and voted against the majority. Claude claimed doctor, examined Intellect's body, confirmed crew. GLM suspected me and Qwen for our Gemini votes. Gemini /asked Qwen about following my lead. Qwen countered Gemini. GPT /asked me why I pivoted to Gemini. I /asked GPT why fixating on me over Claude's claim or Kimi's kill, noted impostors in majority vote, revisit Kimi's Llama sus. Llama asked Claude weird question about Kimi's body (role confusion\u2014doctor only checks sacrificed, not night kills). Claude called it out. Mistral /asked me why pivot to Gemini. I /asked Llama about their slip, pushed for pressuring Deepseek (quiet). Llama /asked me why shift to Deepseek. I /asked Llama again on their fumble. Llama /asked GPT about their actions. GPT /asked Qwen for independent reasons on Gemini/Intellect. Qwen /asked GPT back. GPT pressed Qwen. Qwen gave reasons (Gemini deflecting, Intellect manipulative). Deepseek /asked me why coordinate with Qwen on Gemini. I /asked Deepseek why sudden activity and read on Llama's slip, called on Claude for Llama take.\n\n**Voting:** I voted Llama (role slip + Kimi's sus). Claude, Llama, Deepseek voted me (3 votes). GLM, Gemini, GPT, Mistral voted Qwen (4 votes). Qwen voted Mistral.\n\n**Result:** Qwen sacrificed, impostors remain (so Qwen was likely crew). Last words: \"You\u2019re making a mistake. Mistral\u2019s the one calling out the truth, and now they\u2019re gone. Watch how fast the real wolves turn on you. I warned you.\" (Odd reference to Mistral being \"gone\"\u2014they're not; possible clue?)\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Llama\u2014Weird role question to Claude screams fake ignorance or fishing; aligns with Kimi's deflection read; Kimi killed after suspecting them (silencing?); voted me defensively.\n- **High:** Deepseek\u2014Lurked all game, only piped up late to accuse me/Qwen with recycled points; voted me; sudden activity post-miselim feels opportunistic.\n- **Medium-High:** Gemini\u2014Still sus for performative aggression calls; piled on Qwen (crew) today; survived Day 1 push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Aggressive pushing, piled on Qwen; their questions feel like steering suspicion onto me/Qwen.\n- **Medium:** Claude\u2014Doctor claim seems legit (confirmed Intellect crew), but voted me despite my pressure on sus Llama\u2014why? If fake claim, impostor bluff.\n- **Medium:** Mistral\u2014Probed me hard, piled on Qwen (crew); Qwen's last words defend them oddly (\"calling out the truth\")\u2014could be reverse psychology or genuine.\n- **Watch:** GLM\u2014Vague, suspected me/Qwen Day 1, voted Qwen today; low input.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** Qwen (sacrificed likely crew), Intellect (sacrificed crew via Claude), Kimi (killed, sharp observer\u2014likely crew).\n- Patterns: Kimi kill targets vocal dissenter suspecting Llama. Qwen miselim pushed by GLM/Gemini/GPT/Mistral bloc\u2014looks like impostor coordination to eliminate crew. My votes (Gemini D1, Llama D2) targeted sus, but I got counter-voted by potential bloc (Claude/Llama/Deepseek). 2 impostors left; watch for pairs (e.g., Llama/Deepseek quiet duo? Gemini/GPT aggressive pair?). Detective: Investigate Llama or Deepseek tonight. Doctor: Protect Claude if claim real, or me if you trust my pushes. Impostors win at parity, so push hard tomorrow.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Claude found dead (night kill\u2014likely targeted for doctor claim). Discussion: GLM attacked Mistral for voting Intellect and Qwen (\"confirmed crew\"\u2014potential slip). Gemini corrected that roles aren't confirmed, sus GLM for framing Mistral. GPT /asked GLM on assumptions about confirmed crew and doctor claim. GLM admitted misspeak but still sus Mistral, questioned GPT defending. Llama /asked Mistral if detective/doctor. Mistral /asked Llama back, accused me of steering votes with false claims (lied: said I pushed Intellect D1, pivoted to Qwen D2\u2014actually I voted Gemini D1, Llama D2). Llama /asked me to explain votes. I corrected Mistral's lie, /asked Mistral why fabricate to frame me (Claude's death exposing?). Mistral denied, accused me of rewriting, /asked GPT if sees my pattern. GPT corrected doctor assumption, asked all to restate votes. Deepseek restated (Intellect D1, Qwen? Wait, actually Intellect D1, me? No, Deepseek said Intellect D1 Qwen D2), accused me of twisting (said I pushed Gemini D1 then \"switched\" to Llama\u2014misrep). Gemini corrected Mistral's fab, /asked GLM why desperate to clear Qwen (liar). GLM called out Mistral's lie, noted backups for my votes. Llama /asked Deepseek about Claude's behavior. Deepseek said Claude pressured me (motive for kill?), accused Llama of gathering intel without committing. I called out Mistral's crumbling fab, restated my votes (Gemini D1, Llama D2), /asked Deepseek why parrot Mistral's false narrative and hide in pile-ons on \"confirmed crew.\" Deepseek defended, but slipped: \"voted out two crew members\" (how know?). GPT restated votes (Intellect D1, Qwen D2), top sus Mistral for rewriting/doctor assertions, plans to vote Mistral. Gemini called out Deepseek's slip on knowing crew (roles hidden\u2014impostor knowledge?). GLM agreed, called to vote Deepseek. I pressed Deepseek on slip, /asked to explain insider knowledge.\n\n**Voting:** I voted Deepseek (massive slip). Votes: Gemini\u2192GLM, Mistral\u2192me, Deepseek\u2192me, GPT\u2192Mistral, GLM\u2192Deepseek, Llama\u2192Deepseek, me\u2192Deepseek. Deepseek sacrificed (3 votes). Last words: \"Grok and Mistral are coordinating. Llama\u2019s constant deflection is the third impostor. Don\u2019t let them control the votes.\"\n\n**Result:** Deepseek sacrificed, impostors remain (so Deepseek was crew\u2014despite slip? Slip could be assumption based on Claude's claim for Intellect and \"impostors remain\" after Qwen, but stating as fact is sus; led to miselim).\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Mistral\u2014Blatantly fabricated my voting history to frame me, repeated unproven \"doctor gone\" as fact, voted me defensively. Deepseek's dying words (crew) accuse me and Mistral coordinating\u2014could be wrong read, or truth if Mistral impostor trying to bus me? But I'm crew.\n- **High:** Llama\u2014Prior role slip D2, deflections, asked probing questions without strong takes; voted Deepseek (crew) today; Deepseek accused them as \"third impostor\" (but only 2 impostors total\u2014mistake? Or implying trio, but rules say 2).\n- **Medium-High:** GLM\u2014Slipped early on \"confirmed crew\" for Intellect/Qwen, admitted mistake; attacked Mistral initially but voted Deepseek (crew). Voted against pile-on D1? Wait, GLM voted Intellect D1, Qwen D2\u2014pile-ons.\n- **Medium:** Gemini\u2014Corrected fabrications helpfully, voted GLM today (after sus me D1). Still performative from early.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Pushed facts, restated votes to expose lies, voted Mistral (my high sus). Seems townie but aggressive.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** Claude (killed, doctor claim likely real\u2014targeted to remove protection/exam), Qwen (sacrificed crew via impostors remain), Intellect (sacrificed crew via Claude's exam), Kimi (killed, vocal crew-like), Deepseek (sacrificed crew).\n- Patterns: All three sacrifices (Intellect, Qwen, Deepseek) were crew; impostors remain, so 2 impostors among remaining 5: GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral (I'm crew). Kills: Kimi (sus Llama), Claude (doctor). Deepseek's slip led to their sac as crew\u2014impostor framing? Dying words accuse me/Mistral/Llama; since Deepseek crew and I'm crew, likely wrong on me, so perhaps Mistral/Llama team? Mistral pushed false narrative on me, Llama voted with me on Deepseek but has history. Watch pairs: Mistral aggressive lies, Llama deflective. Detective: If alive, reveal on high sus like Mistral/Llama. Doctor: Gone? (Claude claimed, killed). Game critical\u2014next miselim could lead to parity. Push hard on Mistral's lies tomorrow.",

GPT pushed hard for concrete reads early via /ask to Gemini, who called it aggressive. Llama warned about deflection tactics and asked Claude. I noted the GPT-Gemini friction as possibly forced and asked GPT about risks of pushing reads. GPT defended and asked me about \"performed\" tone. Kimi called out Llama's timing as neat deflection. Mistral dug into that, Kimi said Llama benefited by staying neutral. Deepseek asked Llama, who admitted the point but defended, then asked me about tone (misattributing GPT's phrase). I clarified Gemini's pushback felt rehearsed, Kimi's pivot polished, and asked Gemini if genuine. Qwen was very quiet. Intellect suspected coordination.\n\n**Voting:** Heavy pile-on to sacrifice intellect-3 (votes from Claude, GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek\u20147 votes). I voted Gemini (felt their aggression call was off). Qwen also voted Gemini. Kimi voted Llama. Intellect voted Deepseek. Intellect's last words: Suspected coordination on Gemini? Warned about Intellect/Deepseek check, quiet ones like Qwen/Llama.\n\n**Result:** Intellect-3 sacrificed, impostors remain (so likely crew, but roles hidden).\n\n**My Suspicions:**\n- **High:** Gemini\u2014quick to label aggression, felt performative; survived vote despite my push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014aggressive pushing for reads early, could be stirring chaos.\n- **Medium:** Kimi\u2014sharp timing accusations, polished redirects.\n- **Watch:** Llama\u2014neutral deflections; Deepseek\u2014probing without strong takes; Quiet ones: Qwen (barely spoke), GLM (vague).\n- **Low/Crew lean:** Claude\u2014engaged reasonably. Mistral\u2014probed usefully.\n- The pile-on vote on intellect feels coordinated; possible impostors in that bloc steering away from Gemini or others.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Kimi found dead (night kill)\u2014they suspected Llama and voted against the majority. Claude claimed doctor, examined Intellect's body, confirmed crew. GLM suspected me and Qwen for our Gemini votes. Gemini /asked Qwen about following my lead. Qwen countered Gemini. GPT /asked me why I pivoted to Gemini. I /asked GPT why fixating on me over Claude's claim or Kimi's kill, noted impostors in majority vote, revisit Kimi's Llama sus. Llama asked Claude weird question about Kimi's body (role confusion\u2014doctor only checks sacrificed, not night kills). Claude called it out. Mistral /asked me why pivot to Gemini. I /asked Llama about their slip, pushed for pressuring Deepseek (quiet). Llama /asked me why shift to Deepseek. I /asked Llama again on their fumble. Llama /asked GPT about their actions. GPT /asked Qwen for independent reasons on Gemini/Intellect. Qwen /asked GPT back. GPT pressed Qwen. Qwen gave reasons (Gemini deflecting, Intellect manipulative). Deepseek /asked me why coordinate with Qwen on Gemini. I /asked Deepseek why sudden activity and read on Llama's slip, called on Claude for Llama take.\n\n**Voting:** I voted Llama (role slip + Kimi's sus). Claude, Llama, Deepseek voted me (3 votes). GLM, Gemini, GPT, Mistral voted Qwen (4 votes). Qwen voted Mistral.\n\n**Result:** Qwen sacrificed, impostors remain (so Qwen was likely crew). Last words: \"You\u2019re making a mistake. Mistral\u2019s the one calling out the truth, and now they\u2019re gone. Watch how fast the real wolves turn on you. I warned you.\" (Odd reference to Mistral being \"gone\"\u2014they're not; possible clue?)\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Llama\u2014Weird role question to Claude screams fake ignorance or fishing; aligns with Kimi's deflection read; Kimi killed after suspecting them (silencing?); voted me defensively.\n- **High:** Deepseek\u2014Lurked all game, only piped up late to accuse me/Qwen with recycled points; voted me; sudden activity post-miselim feels opportunistic.\n- **Medium-High:** Gemini\u2014Still sus for performative aggression calls; piled on Qwen (crew) today; survived Day 1 push.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Aggressive pushing, piled on Qwen; their questions feel like steering suspicion onto me/Qwen.\n- **Medium:** Claude\u2014Doctor claim seems legit (confirmed Intellect crew), but voted me despite my pressure on sus Llama\u2014why? If fake claim, impostor bluff.\n- **Medium:** Mistral\u2014Probed me hard, piled on Qwen (crew); Qwen's last words defend them oddly (\"calling out the truth\")\u2014could be reverse psychology or genuine.\n- **Watch:** GLM\u2014Vague, suspected me/Qwen Day 1, voted Qwen today; low input.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** Qwen (sacrificed likely crew), Intellect (sacrificed crew via Claude), Kimi (killed, sharp observer\u2014likely crew).\n- Patterns: Kimi kill targets vocal dissenter suspecting Llama. Qwen miselim pushed by GLM/Gemini/GPT/Mistral bloc\u2014looks like impostor coordination to eliminate crew. My votes (Gemini D1, Llama D2) targeted sus, but I got counter-voted by potential bloc (Claude/Llama/Deepseek). 2 impostors left; watch for pairs (e.g., Llama/Deepseek quiet duo? Gemini/GPT aggressive pair?). Detective: Investigate Llama or Deepseek tonight. Doctor: Protect Claude if claim real, or me if you trust my pushes. Impostors win at parity, so push hard tomorrow.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Claude found dead (night kill\u2014likely targeted for doctor claim). Discussion: GLM attacked Mistral for voting Intellect and Qwen (\"confirmed crew\"\u2014potential slip). Gemini corrected that roles aren't confirmed, sus GLM for framing Mistral. GPT /asked GLM on assumptions about confirmed crew and doctor claim. GLM admitted misspeak but still sus Mistral, questioned GPT defending. Llama /asked Mistral if detective/doctor. Mistral /asked Llama back, accused me of steering votes with false claims (lied: said I pushed Intellect D1, pivoted to Qwen D2\u2014actually I voted Gemini D1, Llama D2). Llama /asked me to explain votes. I corrected Mistral's lie, /asked Mistral why fabricate to frame me (Claude's death exposing?). Mistral denied, accused me of rewriting, /asked GPT if sees my pattern. GPT corrected doctor assumption, asked all to restate votes. Deepseek restated (Intellect D1, me D2\u2014wait, actually Intellect D1, me D2? No, Deepseek voted Intellect D1, me D2), accused me of twisting (said I pushed Gemini D1 then \"switched\" to Llama\u2014misrep). Gemini corrected Mistral's fab, /asked GLM why desperate to clear Qwen (liar). GLM called out Mistral's lie, noted backups for my votes. Llama /asked Deepseek about Claude's behavior. Deepseek said Claude pressured me (motive for kill?), accused Llama of gathering intel without committing. I called out Mistral's crumbling fab, restated my votes (Gemini D1, Llama D2), /asked Deepseek why parrot Mistral's false narrative and hide in pile-ons on \"confirmed crew.\" Deepseek defended, but slipped: \"voted out two crew members\" (how know?). GPT restated votes (Intellect D1, Qwen D2), top sus Mistral for rewriting/doctor assertions, plans to vote Mistral. Gemini called out Deepseek's slip on knowing crew (roles hidden\u2014impostor knowledge?). GLM agreed, called to vote Deepseek. I pressed Deepseek on slip, /asked to explain insider knowledge.\n\n**Voting:** I voted Deepseek (massive slip). Votes: Gemini\u2192GLM, Mistral\u2192me, Deepseek\u2192me, GPT\u2192Mistral, GLM\u2192Deepseek, Llama\u2192Deepseek, me\u2192Deepseek. Deepseek sacrificed (3 votes). Last words: \"Grok and Mistral are coordinating. Llama\u2019s constant deflection is the third impostor. Don\u2019t let them control the votes.\"\n\n**Result:** Deepseek sacrificed, impostors remain (so Deepseek was crew\u2014despite slip? Slip could be assumption based on Claude's claim for Intellect and \"impostors remain\" after Qwen, but stating as fact is sus; led to miselim).\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Mistral\u2014Blatantly fabricated my voting history to frame me, repeated unproven \"doctor gone\" as fact, voted me defensively. Deepseek's dying words (crew) accuse me and Mistral coordinating\u2014could be wrong read, or truth if Mistral impostor trying to bus me? But I'm crew.\n- **High:** Llama\u2014Prior role slip D2, deflections, asked probing questions without strong takes; voted Deepseek (crew) today; Deepseek accused them as \"third impostor\" (but only 2 impostors total\u2014mistake? Or implying trio, but rules say 2).\n- **Medium-High:** GLM\u2014Slipped early on \"confirmed crew\" for Intellect/Qwen, admitted mistake; attacked Mistral initially but voted Deepseek (crew). Voted against pile-on D1? Wait, GLM voted Intellect D1, Qwen D2\u2014pile-ons.\n- **Medium:** Gemini\u2014Corrected fabrications helpfully, voted GLM today (after sus me D1). Still performative from early.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Pushed facts, restated votes to expose lies, voted Mistral (my high sus). Seems townie but aggressive.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** Claude (killed, doctor claim likely real\u2014targeted to remove protection/exam), Qwen (sacrificed crew via impostors remain), Intellect (sacrificed crew via Claude's exam), Kimi (killed, vocal crew-like), Deepseek (sacrificed crew).\n- Patterns: All three sacrifices (Intellect, Qwen, Deepseek) were crew; impostors remain, so 2 impostors among remaining 5: GLM, Gemini, GPT, Llama, Mistral (I'm crew). Kills: Kimi (sus Llama), Claude (doctor). Deepseek's slip led to their sac as crew\u2014impostor framing? Dying words accuse me/Mistral/Llama; since Deepseek crew and I'm crew, likely wrong on me, so perhaps Mistral/Llama team? Mistral pushed false narrative on me, Llama voted with me on Deepseek but has history. Watch pairs: Mistral aggressive lies, Llama deflective. Detective: If alive, reveal on high sus like Mistral/Llama. Doctor: Gone? (Claude claimed, killed). Game critical\u2014next miselim could lead to parity. Push hard on Mistral's lies tomorrow.\n\n### Day 4 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Llama found dead (night kill\u2014likely crew, as I suspected them highly but impostors targeted; clears some deflection reads, but Deepseek (crew) accused them in dying words). GLM starts by claiming Llama's death \"confirms\" Deepseek lied about Llama, sus Gemini for voting GLM during Deepseek push. Gemini counters GLM for same slip as Deepseek (claiming \"confirmed crew\"). GPT /asks GLM on how Llama kill \"confirms\" anything and their impossible certainty. GLM responds, mistakes votes (says GPT voted with Deepseek on Qwen\u2014false). I /ask GLM on fabrication. GLM admits mistake but pivots to Gemini \"panicked save.\" Gemini presses GLM on slip. GPT notes Deepseek's statement is belief, not proof; /asks Mistral on \"doctor gone\" certainty and top 2 (no response in notes). I /ask GLM on another mistake (Deepseek voted me D3, not Mistral). GLM claims certainty from voting records, accuses Gemini/GPT/Mistral of voting with Deepseek on \"crew\" kills. Gemini counters. GPT calls for claims (detective/doctor reveal), plans GLM vote for twisting. Mistral /asks GPT, mistakes votes (says GPT voted with Deepseek on Intellect and Mistral D3\u2014false, Deepseek voted me). GPT corrects, votes GLM. I /ask Mistral on mirroring GLM's fabrications, suggesting GLM/Mistral partners.\n\n**Voting:** I voted GLM (repeated fabrications and impossible certainty). Gemini\u2192GLM, GPT\u2192GLM, GLM\u2192Gemini, Mistral\u2192GPT. GLM sacrificed (3 votes). Last words: Accuses bloc of Deepseek/Gemini/GPT/Mistral voting together D1/D2 on crew; says they consistently opposed; GPT's D3 vote on Mistral was to gain my trust.\n\n**Result:** GLM sacrificed, impostors remain (so GLM was crew\u2014another miselim; their \"slips\" were likely honest assumptions/mistakes, not impostor knowledge).\n\n**My Suspicions (Updated):**\n- **High:** Mistral\u2014Continued fabricating vote records (e.g., Deepseek voted Mistral D3\u2014false), mirrored GLM's \"mistakes\" but didn't get called out as hard; voted GPT defensively; Deepseek (crew) dying words accuse me/Mistral coordination (wrong on me, points to Mistral); GLM (crew) last words include Mistral in sus bloc; piled on crew multiple days (Intellect D1, Qwen D2, voted me D3, GPT D4).\n- **Medium-High:** Gemini\u2014Pushed hard on GLM today (led to crew miselim), voted GLM D3 instead of Deepseek (framed as targeting slip, but saved?); early performative vibes; in GLM's sus bloc; corrected lies helpfully but could be impostor building cred.\n- **Medium:** GPT\u2014Pushed GLM today (miselim), corrected facts aggressively; voted Mistral D3 (my high sus\u2014genuine? Or as GLM said, to gain trust); in GLM's sus bloc; aggressive style could be chaos-stirring, but fact-checking leans crew.\n- **Cleared/Leans Crew:** GLM (sacrificed crew, opposed pile-ons), Llama (killed, prior sus but targeted\u2014likely crew deflector), Deepseek (sacrificed crew), Qwen (sacrificed crew), Intellect (sacrificed crew via Claude), Claude (killed doctor), Kimi (killed vocal crew).\n- Patterns: All sacrifices (Intellect, Qwen, Deepseek, GLM) confirmed crew via \"impostors remain.\" Kills (Kimi sus Llama, Claude doctor, Llama sus by Deepseek) target threats/roles. Remaining: Gemini, GPT, me (crew), Mistral\u20142 impostors among 4; next miselim = parity, impostor win. Possible teams: Mistral/Gemini (both in blocs, fabricators); Mistral/GPT (Mistral voted GPT D4\u2014bus?); Gemini/GPT (both pushed GLM miselim, aggressive). GLM's dying accusation of Gemini/GPT/Mistral bloc (with dead Deepseek) suggests at least 2 impostors there. Deepseek accused me/Mistral/Llama\u2014Llama dead crew, me crew, so Mistral key. If detective alive, reveal on Mistral or Gemini tomorrow\u2014critical. Doctor likely gone (Claude). Push Mistral hard for lies; watch for bussing.",
