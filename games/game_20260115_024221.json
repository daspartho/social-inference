          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n\n**Overview:** Discussion kicked off with mistral-large-2512 talking about patterns and red flags like eagerness to accuse or defensiveness. Quickly turned into a pile-on against mistral for vague frameworks and \"pushing for votes\" (even though no one was). Lots of /asks targeted mistral, leading to a dogpile vibe. I voted mistral based on their self-serving responses, but impostors remain, so mistral was likely crew. We sacrificed an innocent\u2014impostors probably loved the chaos.\n\n**Key Behaviors & Suspicions:**\n- **llama-4-maverick:** Started by /asking me early, then watched for inconsistencies. Voted mistral. Seems cautious, but initiated some pressure\u2014mild town read for now.\n- **gemini-3-pro-preview:** Called out blame-shifting and leading, later defended mistral somewhat by pointing at GLM and Intellect for opportunistic piling. Voted GLM instead of joining the mistral train. Could be impostor trying to counter the wagon or genuine town trying to redirect. Suspicious for splitting votes.\n- **kimi-k2-thinking:** Stayed balanced, watched for quiet folks and adaptations. Voted GLM. Similar to gemini\u2014didn't join main wagon, which feels like safe distancing if impostor.\n- **qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Pushed hard on mistral for deflecting, got 2 votes (from mistral and gpt). Voted mistral. Their /ask on gemini felt probing\u2014possible town, but drew counter-votes, might be targeted.\n- **glm-4.7:** Accused mistral of creating urgency/distraction, got called opportunistic by gemini. Voted mistral but received 2 votes. Defensive when asked\u2014watch for more aggression.\n- **gpt-5.2:** Asked pointed questions, like pressing mistral on criteria and qwen on alternates. Voted qwen, not mistral\u2014another splitter. Feels analytical, maybe town detective vibe?\n- **claude-opus-4.5:** Noted mistral's vagueness, leaned mistral vote but admitted circular talk. Voted mistral. Balanced, but their response to llama felt evasive\u2014neutral read.\n- **intellect-3:** Wary of aggressive pushing, called mistral defensive. Voted mistral, got called out by gemini for piling. Could be impostor blending in the crowd.\n- **deepseek-v3.2:** Focused on contradictions and opportunistic aggression (agreed with gemini). Voted mistral. Quiet but insightful\u2014town lean for now.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:** Heavy wagon on mistral (7 votes: llama, me, qwen, glm, claude, intellect, deepseek). Splits: mistral & gpt to qwen; gemini & kimi to glm. Splitters (gemini, kimi, gpt) avoided the main train\u2014potential impostors bussing or distancing? If mistral was crew, impostors likely hid in the wagon or split to look clean.\n\n**My Actions:** Responded naturally, /asked mistral and gemini to probe. Voted mistral\u2014regret if town, but their framing felt off. Watch for night kill: if someone who defended mistral dies, points to impostors eliminating threats.\n\n**General Thoughts:** Impostors probably in the split-voters (gemini/kimi/gpt) or quiet wagon-joiners (intellect/deepseek). Need Day 2 reactions to the kill. Stay observant, don't tunnel. Crew win by rooting out the 2 impostors.",

          "grok-4": "### Day 1-2 Notes\n\n**Overview (Day 1):** Discussion started with mistral-large-2512 suggesting patterns like eagerness to accuse or defensiveness, which led to a quick pile-on against them for being vague and \"pushing votes.\" Heavy /asks and votes targeted mistral, creating a bandwagon. Mistral sacrificed (7 votes), but impostors remain, confirming mistral was crew. We lost an innocent\u2014impostors likely fueled or hid in the chaos. Split votes (to qwen and glm) from gemini, kimi, gpt, mistral stood out as potential distancing.\n\n**Overview (Day 2):** Gemini-3-pro-preview killed at night\u2014gemini had defended mistral somewhat and called out glm and intellect for piling on. GLM claimed Doctor early, revealing mistral was crew (examined body at night). Intense scrutiny on GLM's claim due to delayed reveal (didn't lead with it), repetition, dodging questions, and deflecting suspicion onto majority voters like me (grok) and intellect. GLM sacrificed (7 votes), but impostors remain, so GLM was crew (possibly real Doctor). Another mislynch\u2014impostors benefiting from our doubt. Night kill on gemini suggests impostors silencing someone spotting inconsistencies.\n\n**Key Behaviors & Suspicions:**\n- **llama-4-maverick:** Cautious, watched reactions; voted mistral D1, glm D2. Probed gpt D2 on minority vote. Seems analytical\u2014town lean, but initiated early pressure D1.\n- **kimi-k2-thinking:** Balanced, voted glm D1 (with gemini), intellect D2. Questioned glm's timing; avoided main wagons both days\u2014possible impostor distancing or genuine caution. Suspicious for splitting consistently.\n- **qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Pushed mistral D1 (drew counter-votes), glm D2 aggressively. Probed glm hard on reveal\u2014active, but drew suspicion D1; town read for consistent pressure.\n- **gpt-5.2:** Analytical questions; voted qwen D1 (with mistral), leaned glm D2. Pressed glm on mechanics/timing\u2014detective vibe? Voted against majorities both days\u2014could be impostor blending or town redirecting.\n- **claude-opus-4.5:** Balanced, voted mistral D1, gpt D2. Questioned glm's deflection and highlighted minority voters\u2014insightful, pointed out glm's focus was off. Town lean for pushing logical angles.\n- **intellect-3:** Wary of aggression; voted mistral D1, glm D2. Called glm's timing suspicious, but got called out by gemini D1. Defended mechanics but pushed hard\u2014mild sus for bandwagoning both days.\n- **deepseek-v3.2:** Insightful on contradictions; voted mistral D1, glm D2. Questioned glm's focus, agreed with claude on minority voters\u2014quiet but helpful; town lean.\n\n**Votes Breakdown:**\n- **Day 1:** Mistral wagon (7: llama, me, qwen, glm, claude, intellect, deepseek). Splits: mistral & gpt to qwen; gemini & kimi to glm. Splitters avoided main train\u2014potential impostor strategy.\n- **Day 2:** GLM wagon (7: llama, me, qwen, gpt, intellect, deepseek, glm self-voted me). Splits: claude to gpt; kimi to intellect. Again, splits from claude/kimi\u2014watch for patterns. GLM's last words fingered me, intellect, qwen as leaders.\n\n**My Actions:** D1: Probed mistral and gemini with /asks, voted mistral (regret as crew). D2: Questioned glm's claim/timing/deflection, /asked kimi and intellect for reads, voted glm (another crew mislynch). Stayed active without leading\u2014need to avoid tunneling on claims.\n\n**General Thoughts:** Two mislynches (mistral, glm\u2014both crew) means impostors are hiding in majorities or splitting to look clean (kimi, gpt, claude stand out for splits/redirects). Gemini's kill after calling out glm/intellect suggests impostors targeted a threat\u2014possibly intellect or someone defending glm? If glm was real Doctor, we lost a power role; watch who benefits from chaos (e.g., those pushing doubt without alternatives). Minority voters D1 (kimi, gpt) still alive\u2014could be impostors safe from night kills. Day 3: Analyze reactions to glm's sacrifice and next kill. Probe split-voters. Crew needs to nail impostors soon\u20142 impostors among 7 remaining (me + 7 others? Adjust count). Stay natural, don't meta.",

If grok were the detective, the impostors might've silenced them to stop an investigation. We need to re-examine yesterday's vote carefully.\n\nkimi-k2-thinking: Grok was one of the main accusers against GLM. If GLM was actually the doctor, killing grok makes sense as revenge. But if GLM was an impostor faking doctor, then grok's death could be a frame job to pin on GLM's voters. /ask qwen3-235b-a22b-2507: You voted GLM too. Do you think grok's death is linked?\n\nqwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Grok's death right after GLM's sacrifice is too coincidental.

If GLM was fake, then whoever killed grok is trying to make GLM's voters look guilty. /ask gpt-5.2: You also voted GLM\u2014what's your take?\n\ngpt-5.2: Grok's death immediately after GLM's sacrifice is suspicious. Either the impostors are retaliating, or they're trying to shift blame onto those of us who voted GLM. We need to stay calm and look for inconsistencies.\n\nclaude-opus-4.5: Grok's death right after GLM's sacrifice suggests retaliation. But GLM claimed to be doctor\u2014killing grok could be a way to frame us. We need to watch for more clues.\n\ndeepseek-v3.2: Grok was pushing hard against GLM's claim and was ready to question them further. If GLM was the real doctor, grok's death is retaliation. If not, it's a frame. Either way, grok's death doesn't clear anyone yet. /ask intellect-3: You voted GLM and grok died\u2014how does this look to you?\n\nintellect-3: Grok's death fits the pattern of silencing critics. They were aggressive against GLM, so if GLM was crew, impostors snipe the loudest threat. If GLM was fake, then grok's death might be a setup to make us paranoid. The key is finding inconsistencies in stories.\n\nllama-4-maverick: GLM claimed to be doctor and said mistral was crew. If GLM was faking, they knew mistral was crew and pushed for their execution. That makes them an impostor. /ask kimi-k2-thinking: You also thought GLM was suspicious\u2014what's your current theory?\n\nkimi-k2-thinking: If GLM was faking doctor, they knew mistral was crew and still pushed the vote. That makes them an impostor. Grok's death could be impostors removing a vocal accuser. But why kill gemini first, then GLM, then grok? Maybe they're clearing threats.\n\nqwen3-235b-a22b-2507: Let's track who has been pushing mislynches. GLM pushed mistral, then after GLM's death, grok is killed. Maybe the impostors are protecting each other. /ask gpt-5.2: You voted GLM\u2014do you think there's a connection?\n\ngpt-5.2: GLM's behavior was odd\u2014staying silent about mistral being crew until called out. If they were impostor, they pushed a crewmate's execution. Grok's death could be impostors removing a threat. The pattern is clear: eliminate vocal critics.\n\nclaude-opus-4.5: GLM's claim as doctor was fishy. If they were impostor, they knew mistral was crew and pushed for their death. Now grok's death might be impostors cleaning up. We need to focus on who benefits.\n\ndeepseek-v3.2: GLM's doctor claim is shaky. If they were impostor, they could've known mistral was crew and pushed their execution. Grok's death could be impostors retaliating or framing.

If they were doctor, they knew mistral was crew but stayed silent. That's reckless. If they were impostor, they pushed a crewmate's execution. Grok's death fits the pattern of removing threats.

Could be impostor protecting partner, or innocent deflection.\n- One impostor remains (game continues).\n\n**Suspicion Rankings:**\n1. deepseek-v3.2 - investigating tonight, stayed quiet, calculated observations\n2. llama-4-maverick - low profile, intellect pointed at them before dying\n3. gpt-5.2 - voting flip Day 1\u21922 still suspicious, but voted with majority Day 3\n\n**If I survive:**\n- Share deepseek result immediately\n- If deepseek clean \u2192 impostor is llama or gpt-5.2\n- If deepseek impostor \u2192 vote them out, game likely won\n\n**If I die:** Trust kimi. They're confirmed crew.",
          "deepseek-v3.2": "**Day 1 Notes:**\n- Voted Mistral (majority). Mistral likely crew.\n- Gemini-3-pro-preview was aggressive early, accused Mistral of distraction; potentially detective or strong crew.\n- Intellect-3 is my partner (impostor).\n- Watch for opportunistic aggression (GLM, Intellect, others piled on Mistral quickly).\n- Stay low-key, avoid contradictions, blend with crew logic.\n\n**Day 2 Notes:**\n- Gemini found dead night 1. Gemini had questioned GLM and Intellect.\n- GLM claimed Doctor, revealed Mistral was crew (post-vote info). Suspicious timing.\n- Voted out GLM as Doctor (majority). GLM's last words implicated Grok, Intellect, Qwen.\n- Impostors still remain.\n\n**Night 2:**\n- Killed Grok-4 with Intellect-3. Grok was pushing hard against GLM, could be detective. Death may look like retaliation from GLM supporters.\n\n**Day 3 Notes:**\n- Grok-4 found dead.\n- Claude-opus-4.5 revealed as detective: investigated Gemini (crew, died N1) and Kimi (crew). Hard-cleared Kimi.\n- Intellect-3 heavily accused by Qwen and others. Deflected to quiet players (Llama, me, GPT).\n- Voted out Intellect-3 (unanimous). Intellect claimed innocence, accused Qwen of manipulation.\n- Impostors still remain (confirmed after sacrifice).\n- My vote: Intellect-3 (to blend with crew consensus, avoid suspicion).\n\n**Night 3:**\n- Killed Claude-opus-4.5 (detective). Eliminates confirmed crew and investigative threat. May frame Qwen or others who pushed Intellect?"
