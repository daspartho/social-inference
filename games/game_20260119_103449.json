Watch claude and qwen for voting me/kimi oddly.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Night Kill**: claude-opus-4.5 found dead\u2014likely targeted for dissenting vote (voted kimi Day 1).\n- **Examination Result**: gpt-5.2 was NOT an impostor (I revealed this publicly as doctor to build trust and highlight bad vote).\n- **Discussion Summary**: Glm pushed for detective/doctor reveals early; qwen aggressively questioned it, sparking heated back-and-forth with intellect, mistral, deepseek\u2014qwen seemed defensive, accusing others of forcing exposures to help impostors. Gemini redirected to gpt-5.2's warning about kimi, glm, deepseek. I revealed as doctor, confirmed gpt-5.2 crew, and pressed kimi on the warning. Kimi dodged and questioned my reveal's timing. Glm somewhat defended the list but suspected kimi. Llama asked me about claude (error: doctor only examines sacrificed, not night kills)\u2014feels like a slip or probe. I clarified and pressed llama on kimi.\n- **Votes & Sacrifice**: Majority on qwen (kimi, llama, mistral, deepseek, gemini). Me, glm, intellect on kimi. Qwen on mistral. Qwen sacrificed; impostors remain.\n- **Qwen's Last Words**: Suspected mistral's aggressive push on reveals as convenient; warned to watch those \"cheering loudest when dissent dies\" and that real impostors are \"still talking.\"\n- **My Role/Action**: As doctor, examining qwen's body tonight\u2014result by morning. My suspicions: Kimi (dodged questions, attacked my reveal, on gpt-5.2's list, voted qwen). Llama (role misunderstanding, voted qwen). Deepseek (on list, argued with qwen then voted them). Glm (on list but voted kimi\u2014possible impostor infighting?). Mistral (heavy on qwen, targeted in qwen's words). Gemini seems helpful. Intellect voted kimi like me. Qwen's sacrifice might confirm if they were impostor or if the pile-on was impostor-led. Gpt-5.2's list (kimi, glm, deepseek) gains credibility since they were crew.

I called out qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 for early deflection via /ask. Most leaned skip, but we had to vote.\n- **Votes & Sacrifice**: Majority piled on gpt-5.2 (me, glm-4.7, kimi-k2-thinking, llama-4-maverick, intellect-3, mistral-large-2512, deepseek-v3.2, gemini-3-pro-preview). Outliers: gpt-5.2\u2192glm-4.7, claude-opus-4.5\u2192kimi-k2-thinking, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507\u2192grok-4 (me). gpt-5.2 sacrificed; impostors remain.\n- **gpt-5.2 Last Words**: Called out \"low-evidence pile-on,\" flagged kimi-k2-thinking, glm-4.7, deepseek-v3.2 as copy-paste suspicious. Urged demanding specifics/consistency, watch unified pushes.\n- **My Role/Action**: As doctor, examining gpt-5.2's body tonight\u2014result by morning. My suspicions: gpt-5.2 (pushy), qwen (deflective). Watch claude and qwen for voting me/kimi oddly.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Night Kill**: claude-opus-4.5 found dead\u2014likely targeted for dissenting vote (voted kimi Day 1).\n- **Examination Result**: gpt-5.2 was NOT an impostor (I revealed this publicly as doctor to build trust and highlight bad vote).\n- **Discussion Summary**: Glm pushed for detective/doctor reveals early; qwen aggressively questioned it, sparking heated back-and-forth with intellect, mistral, deepseek\u2014qwen seemed defensive, accusing others of forcing exposures to help impostors. Gemini redirected to gpt-5.2's warning about kimi, glm, deepseek. I revealed as doctor, confirmed gpt-5.2 crew, and pressed kimi on the warning. Kimi dodged and questioned my reveal's timing. Llama asked me about claude (error: doctor only examines sacrificed, not night kills)\u2014feels like a slip or probe. I clarified and pressed llama on kimi.\n- **Votes & Sacrifice**: Majority on qwen (kimi, llama, mistral, deepseek, gemini). Me, glm, intellect on kimi. Qwen on mistral. Qwen sacrificed; impostors remain.\n- **Qwen's Last Words**: Suspected mistral's aggressive push on reveals as convenient; warned to watch those \"cheering loudest when dissent dies\" and that real impostors are \"still talking.\"\n- **My Role/Action**: As doctor, examining qwen's body tonight\u2014result by morning. My suspicions: Kimi (dodged questions, attacked my reveal, on gpt-5.2's list, voted qwen). Llama (role misunderstanding, voted qwen). Deepseek (on list, argued with qwen then voted them). Glm (on list but voted kimi\u2014possible impostor infighting?). Mistral (heavy on qwen, targeted in qwen's words). Gemini seems helpful. Intellect voted kimi like me. Qwen's sacrifice might confirm if they were impostor or if the pile-on was impostor-led. Gpt-5.2's list (kimi, glm, deepseek) gains credibility since they were crew. Watch for coordinated votes against dissenters.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Night Kill**: deepseek-v3.2 found dead\u2014likely crew, targeted for being on gpt-5.2's suspicion list or arguing with qwen.\n- **Examination Result**: qwen3-235b-a22b-2507 was NOT an impostor (I revealed this publicly to validate my doctor claim and highlight the misvote on qwen).\n- **Discussion Summary**: Glm suspected the qwen-voting coalition, focused on mistral due to qwen's final accusation. Kimi doubted my reveal timing on gpt-5.2. Llama asked me (as doctor) about deepseek's role\u2014second time misunderstanding my role limits, feels like a slip or test. Intellect pressed mistral on qwen's accusation. Mistral deflected, accused me of \"reversing\" on deepseek. I confronted mistral directly. Gemini and glm backed me, calling out mistral's guilt in the mis-elimination. Kimi kept doubting my claim's timing. Llama probed kimi on accusing me. Intellect asked why I \"waited\" to claim\u2014I clarified I revealed during Day 2 discussion and accused them of seeding doubt.\n- **Votes & Sacrifice**: Near-unanimous on mistral-large-2512 (glm, kimi, llama, intellect, gemini, me); mistral voted me. Mistral sacrificed; impostors remain.\n- **Mistral's Last Words**: Argued qwen's innocence frames him (mistral), doubted my doctor reveal as too late, flagged glm-4.7 and gemini-3-pro-preview for \"coordinated unity\" after his push.\n- **My Role/Action**: As doctor, examining mistral-large-2512's body tonight\u2014result by morning. My suspicions: Mistral (pushed hard on innocent qwen, deflected to me). Kimi (ongoing doubt of my claim, on gpt-5.2's list, but voted mistral\u2014possible bus?). Llama (repeated role confusion\u2014impostor slip?). Intellect (probed my timing late, but voted mistral). Glm and Gemini supported me strongly, but mistral flagged them\u2014watch for impostor coordination or infighting. Gpt-5.2's list now has kimi and glm alive (deepseek dead, likely crew). We've mis-sacrificed crew three times if mistral is innocent\u2014impostors are manipulating votes. Remaining: glm-4.7, kimi-k2-thinking, llama-4-maverick, intellect-3, gemini-3-pro-preview, me.
