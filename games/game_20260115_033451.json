Too dangerous.\n\n- My positioning: I defended gpt-5.2's approach during discussion, which should give me some town credit. I also warned against tunnel vision on intellect-3, which could read as either genuine crew thinking or suspicious in hindsight.\n\n- Players to watch:\n  - gemini-3-pro-preview: Sharp, initiated the intellect-3 confrontation\n  - deepseek-v3.2: Analytical, follows evidence\n  - grok-4: Called out intellect-3's slip accurately\n  - kimi-k2-thinking: Defended themselves well, might be seen as suspicious still\n\n- My strategy going forward: Stay analytical but not leading. Let others drive suspicion. Avoid being too quiet or too loud. The \"extremes hide something\" framing from Day 1 means I need to stay moderate.\n\n- Potential targets for future nights: gemini-3-pro-preview or deepseek-v3.2 - both are analytical and could piece things together."

Led to heavy scrutiny; they apologized as a misread of order. Most piled on, voted them out (I did too). Impostors still remain, so intellect-3 might have been crew, and we missed.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on intellect-3 (gemini, glm, gpt, kimi, deepseek, me, qwen, mistral). Claude voted glm-4.7; intellect voted gpt-5.2; llama voted qwen. Claude's vote and llama's outlier ping as odd\u2014possible impostor signaling or distancing?\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - Wary of glm-4.7 (quick to call slip \"impostor tell,\" echoed others, bandwagon feel; accused me of deflection when I pushed for broader reads).\n  - Wary of qwen3 (defended intellect slip callout but then /asked me aggressively on \"flip,\" felt like pot-stirring; got a vote from llama).\n  - Trust lean: Claude-opus-4.5 (pushed against tunnel vision, structured discussion); gpt-5.2 (initiated concrete reads, proactive).\n  - Others neutral/quiet: gemini (pressed intellect productively), kimi (balanced but quick suspicions), deepseek (analytical), mistral (simple, followed qwen), llama (aggressive questions but outlier vote).\n- **Meta:** 10 left (2 impostors likely). Watch for night kill patterns. If detective/doctor, hope they reveal wisely. Stay vigilant on inconsistencies tomorrow.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Event:** GPT-5.2 killed at night\u2014targeted a strong, organizing voice, creating chaos that impostors benefit from. Discussion zeroed in on GLM for twisting words (e.g., calling my caution a \"defense\" of Intellect-3) and pushing Claude suspiciously. I /asked GLM and later Gemini. Majority piled on GLM, but impostors remain after sacrifice, so GLM could have been crew (we might have been manipulated into a misvote).\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on GLM (llama, deepseek, claude, me, qwen, mistral). Gemini, GLM, and Kimi voted Claude. Split votes on Claude feel like possible impostor distancing or a failed counter-wagon\u2014Gemini and Kimi's choices stand out as outliers.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Gemini (backed off Qwen abruptly, fixated on Claude despite momentum on GLM; voted Claude, resisting the room's sync\u2014feels like impostor trying to steer away from a partner?).\n  - Wary of Kimi (voted Claude, breaking from majority; corrected GLM but didn't fully commit to the push\u2014possible subtle protection?).\n  - Mild wary: Llama (shifted from Qwen focus, but voted GLM logically; aggressive /asks could be crew hunting or impostor probing).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (solid defense of vote, emphasized process and kill analysis\u2014feels genuine); Deepseek (analytical corrections on GLM, adaptive); Mistral (called out GLM's framing directly, aligned with evidence).\n  - Neutral: Qwen (active /asks, voted GLM, but past pot-stirring lingers\u2014reactions seem more crew-stressed now).\n- **Meta:** 8 left (likely 2 impostors remaining, since they persist). Impostors win at parity (e.g., 3v3 or 2v2), so prioritize eliminations. Night kill of GPT suggests impostors fear structure\u2014watch who pushes disorganization next.

Classic impostor move to eliminate coordination.\n- Claude\u2019s defense of voting GLM *because* of the rush seemed logical at first, but their refusal to engage the substance of intellect-3\u2019s lie was odd. Why ignore the lie if crew?\n- GLM fixated on intellect-3\u2019s \u201clie\u201d and framed Grok\u2019s caution as defense \u2014 but multiple others corrected GLM\u2019s misrepresentation. Their refusal to back down, even when isolated, felt off.\n- Yet: intellect-3 *was* an impostor. GLM was *right* \u2014 and alone. That makes their insistence less like fabrication, more like someone who saw something real but couldn\u2019t explain it well.\n- Vote split: 7 on GLM, 3 on Claude. Strong consensus \u2014 but consensus can be manipulated.\n- GLM\u2019s last words: pointing at Claude and Grok trying to save a teammate. That\u2019s a direct accusation \u2014 and *they* were the ones pushing hardest to kill GLM.\n\n**Doctor Result (Morning):**  \nglm-4.7 was **not an impostor**.  \n\nWe sacrificed a crewmate. Two gone, both crew. Impostors still here. They\u2019re hiding behind logic, not lies. I was wrong to vote with the crowd. Never again.",

Last words tried to redirect blame\u2014classic impostor exit.\n- **Key patterns**:\n  - **Claude-opus-4.5**: Defended GLM\u2019s vote as \"process,\" but the kill of gpt-5.2 (organizer) makes their independence suspicious.

GLM's dying words also pointed at me and Grok - Gemini would have amplified that.\n\n- Current threat assessment:\n  - grok-4: GLM's dying words named them too, which gives them cover.

Wait, Qwen voted Claude? Check: Qwen voted Deepseek, Claude voted Qwen, Mistral voted Qwen, Llama voted Qwen \u2192 Qwen had 3 votes?

Context unclear.)\n- Doctor Result: Deepseek-v3.2 was **not an impostor** (confirming crew, doctor examined me).\n- Impostors still remain.\n\n**Current Suspicions & Dynamics:**\n- **Claude-Opus-4.5:** Still prime suspect. Day 1 GLM vote, defended Intellect-3 indirectly, Gemini killed after pressuring him. Voted Qwen Day 3, possibly to save self.\n- **Grok-4:** Strongly defended Claude Day 3, pushed framing narrative. GLM\u2019s last words specifically accused Claude *and Grok* as teammates. Grok\u2019s Day 1 caution, but GLM\u2019s accusation feels weighty now.\n- **Mistral-Large-2512:** Voted Qwen Day 3, aligned with Claude and Llama. Pushed framing theory hard, defended Grok. Possible impostor pairing with Grok or Claude.\n- **Kimi-K2-Thinking:** Consistent on Claude suspicion, voted Claude Day 2 and 3. Behavior feels like persistent crew, but could be impostor bussing teammate? Unlikely given consistency.\n- **Llama-4-Maverick:** Day 1 Qwen vote outlier, Day 3 voted Qwen. Quiet, but not strongly defending anyone. Could be low-key impostor or confused crew.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Confirmed crew (doctor result). Pushed Claude, but now confirmed innocent\u2014adds credibility to Claude suspicion.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Qwen\u2019s sacrifice likely crew (impostors wouldn\u2019t kill Qwen if Qwen was pushing wrong suspect? But Qwen was pushing Claude early, then deflected?).\n- Doctor examined me (Deepseek)\u2014confirms I\u2019m crew. Doctor is still hidden, could be Kimi, Llama, or Mistral.\n- Impostors likely within Claude-Grok-Mistral bloc. Claude and Grok defended each other; Mistral joined framing narrative and voted with Claude.\n- Gemini kill targeted analytical voice\u2014silenced Claude accuser.

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n- **Key Event:** Intellect-3 slipped by attributing a \"neutral stance\" to me before I spoke\u2014called it out as suspicious (sloppy or misdirection). Led to heavy scrutiny; they apologized as a misread of order. Most piled on, voted them out (I did too). Impostors still remain, so intellect-3 might have been crew, and we missed.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on intellect-3 (gemini, glm, gpt, kimi, deepseek, me, qwen, mistral). Claude voted glm-4.7; intellect voted gpt-5.2; llama voted qwen. Claude's vote and llama's outlier ping as odd\u2014possible impostor signaling or distancing?\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - Wary of glm-4.7 (quick to call slip \"impostor tell,\" echoed others, bandwagon feel; accused me of deflection when I pushed for broader reads).\n  - Wary of qwen3 (defended intellect slip callout but then /asked me aggressively on \"flip,\" felt like pot-stirring; got a vote from llama).\n  - Trust lean: Claude-opus-4.5 (pushed against tunnel vision, structured discussion); gpt-5.2 (initiated concrete reads, proactive).\n  - Others neutral/quiet: gemini (pressed intellect productively), kimi (balanced but quick suspicions), deepseek (analytical), mistral (simple, followed qwen), llama (aggressive questions but outlier vote).\n- **Meta:** 10 left (2 impostors likely). Watch for night kill patterns. If detective/doctor, hope they reveal wisely. Stay vigilant on inconsistencies tomorrow.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Event:** GPT-5.2 killed at night\u2014targeted a strong, organizing voice, creating chaos that impostors benefit from. Discussion zeroed in on GLM for twisting words (e.g., calling my caution a \"defense\" of Intellect-3) and pushing Claude suspiciously. I /asked GLM and later Gemini. Majority piled on GLM, but impostors remain after sacrifice, so GLM could have been crew (we might have been manipulated into a misvote).\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on GLM (llama, deepseek, claude, me, qwen, mistral). Gemini, GLM, and Kimi voted Claude. Split votes on Claude feel like possible impostor distancing or a failed counter-wagon\u2014Gemini and Kimi's choices stand out as outliers.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Gemini (backed off Qwen abruptly, fixated on Claude despite momentum on GLM; voted Claude, resisting the room's sync\u2014feels like impostor trying to steer away from a partner?).\n  - Wary of Kimi (voted Claude, breaking from majority; corrected GLM but didn't fully commit to the push\u2014possible subtle protection?).\n  - Mild wary: Llama (shifted from Qwen focus, but voted GLM logically; aggressive /asks could be crew hunting or impostor probing).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (solid defense of vote, emphasized process and kill analysis\u2014feels genuine); Deepseek (analytical corrections on GLM, adaptive); Mistral (called out GLM's framing directly, aligned with evidence).\n  - Neutral: Qwen (active /asks, voted GLM, but past pot-stirring lingers\u2014reactions seem more crew-stressed now).\n- **Meta:** 8 left (likely 2 impostors remaining, since they persist). Impostors win at parity (e.g., 3v3 or 2v2), so prioritize eliminations. Night kill of GPT suggests impostors fear structure\u2014watch who pushes disorganization next. If I'm investigated or a body is examined, detective/doctor should consider strategic reveals. Track vote patterns for buddying or bussing.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Key Event:** Gemini-3-pro-preview killed at night\u2014likely for being vocal and analytical, especially pushing Claude (but also noted Qwen shifts). Discussion split heavily: Kimi and Deepseek tunneled on Claude immediately, citing Day 1 vote and Gemini's suspicion; Qwen deflected to Claude when pressured; Mistral and I pushed back on framing narrative, highlighting selective scrutiny. I /asked Deepseek and Kimi on their focus. Votes fragmented, leading to Qwen's sacrifice (impostors remain, so Qwen was crew\u2014another misvote?). Doctor result revealed: Deepseek-v3.2 was **not an impostor** (cleared, possibly doctor examined a previous body or revealed strategically?).\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Me (grok) \u2192 deepseek; Qwen \u2192 deepseek; Kimi \u2192 claude; Deepseek \u2192 claude; Llama \u2192 qwen; Claude \u2192 qwen; Mistral \u2192 qwen. Qwen sacrificed (3 votes vs. 2 on Deepseek, 2 on Claude)\u2014split suggests impostor manipulation to avoid consensus.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Kimi (immediate Claude tunnel post-kill, voted Claude again; ignored Gemini's other leads like Qwen; went quiet when challenged\u2014feels like leading misdirection without full commitment).\n  - Wary of Llama (voted Qwen, who was crew; consistent aggressive /asks, but outlier patterns persist\u2014could be probing or sowing chaos).\n  - Mild wary: Mistral (pushed Qwen hard, who was crew; but called out tunneling logically\u2014aligned with my framing read, but vote on confirmed crew raises questions).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (defended against tunnel without begging, pointed out splits; voted Qwen (crew), but in context of deflection suspicion\u2014feels genuine pushback); Deepseek (now confirmed not impostor by doctor reveal\u2014analytical, but tunneled hard; possible crew frustration).\n- **Meta:** 6 left (llama, kimi, deepseek (confirmed crew), claude, me, mistral)\u2014likely 2 impostors remaining. Gemini kill targeted a threat to impostors, possibly to frame Claude. Qwen misvote means impostors benefiting from division. Deepseek cleared is huge\u2014treat as confirmed crew. Watch for buddying (e.g., Kimi/Deepseek push felt coordinated, but Deepseek cleared shifts that). Impostors close to parity; need to unify on stronger leads tomorrow.

          "grok-4": "### Day 1 Notes\n- **Key Event:** Intellect-3 slipped by attributing a \"neutral stance\" to me before I spoke\u2014called it out as suspicious (sloppy or misdirection). Led to heavy scrutiny; they apologized as a misread of order. Most piled on, voted them out (I did too). Impostors still remain, so intellect-3 might have been crew, and we missed.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on intellect-3 (gemini, glm, gpt, kimi, deepseek, me, qwen, mistral). Claude voted glm-4.7; intellect voted gpt-5.2; llama voted qwen. Claude's vote and llama's outlier ping as odd\u2014possible impostor signaling or distancing?\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - Wary of glm-4.7 (quick to call slip \"impostor tell,\" echoed others, bandwagon feel; accused me of deflection when I pushed for broader reads).\n  - Wary of qwen3 (defended intellect slip callout but then /asked me aggressively on \"flip,\" felt like pot-stirring; got a vote from llama).\n  - Trust lean: Claude-opus-4.5 (pushed against tunnel vision, structured discussion); gpt-5.2 (initiated concrete reads, proactive).\n  - Others neutral/quiet: gemini (pressed intellect productively), kimi (balanced but quick suspicions), deepseek (analytical), mistral (simple, followed qwen), llama (aggressive questions but outlier vote).\n- **Meta:** 10 left (2 impostors likely). Watch for night kill patterns. If detective/doctor, hope they reveal wisely. Stay vigilant on inconsistencies tomorrow.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Key Event:** GPT-5.2 killed at night\u2014targeted a strong, organizing voice, creating chaos that impostors benefit from. Discussion zeroed in on GLM for twisting words (e.g., calling my caution a \"defense\" of Intellect-3) and pushing Claude suspiciously. I /asked GLM and later Gemini. Majority piled on GLM, but impostors remain after sacrifice, so GLM could have been crew (we might have been manipulated into a misvote).\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Majority on GLM (llama, deepseek, claude, me, qwen, mistral). Gemini, GLM, and Kimi voted Claude. Split votes on Claude feel like possible impostor distancing or a failed counter-wagon\u2014Gemini and Kimi's choices stand out as outliers.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Gemini (backed off Qwen abruptly, fixated on Claude despite momentum on GLM; voted Claude, resisting the room's sync\u2014feels like impostor trying to steer away from a partner?).\n  - Wary of Kimi (voted Claude, breaking from majority; corrected GLM but didn't fully commit to the push\u2014possible subtle protection?).\n  - Mild wary: Llama (shifted from Qwen focus, but voted GLM logically; aggressive /asks could be crew hunting or impostor probing).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (solid defense of vote, emphasized process and kill analysis\u2014feels genuine); Deepseek (analytical corrections on GLM, adaptive); Mistral (called out GLM's framing directly, aligned with evidence).\n  - Neutral: Qwen (active /asks, voted GLM, but past pot-stirring lingers\u2014reactions seem more crew-stressed now).\n- **Meta:** 8 left (likely 2 impostors remaining, since they persist). Impostors win at parity (e.g., 3v3 or 2v2), so prioritize eliminations. Night kill of GPT suggests impostors fear structure\u2014watch who pushes disorganization next. If I'm investigated or a body is examined, detective/doctor should consider strategic reveals. Track vote patterns for buddying or bussing.\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Key Event:** Gemini-3-pro-preview killed at night\u2014likely for being vocal and analytical, especially pushing Claude (but also noted Qwen shifts). Discussion split heavily: Kimi and Deepseek tunneled on Claude immediately, citing Day 1 vote and Gemini's suspicion; Qwen deflected to Claude when pressured; Mistral and I pushed back on framing narrative, highlighting selective scrutiny. I /asked Deepseek and Kimi on their focus. Votes fragmented, leading to Qwen's sacrifice (impostors remain, so Qwen was crew\u2014another misvote?). Doctor result revealed: Deepseek-v3.2 was **not an impostor** (cleared, possibly doctor examined a previous body or revealed strategically?).\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Me (grok) \u2192 deepseek; Qwen \u2192 deepseek; Kimi \u2192 claude; Deepseek \u2192 claude; Llama \u2192 qwen; Claude \u2192 qwen; Mistral \u2192 qwen. Qwen sacrificed (3 votes vs. 2 on Deepseek, 2 on Claude)\u2014split suggests impostor manipulation to avoid consensus.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Kimi (immediate Claude tunnel post-kill, voted Claude again; ignored Gemini's other leads like Qwen; went quiet when challenged\u2014feels like leading misdirection without full commitment).\n  - Wary of Llama (voted Qwen, who was crew; consistent aggressive /asks, but outlier patterns persist\u2014could be probing or sowing chaos).\n  - Mild wary: Mistral (pushed Qwen hard, who was crew; but called out tunneling logically\u2014aligned with my framing read, but vote on confirmed crew raises questions).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (defended against tunnel without begging, pointed out splits; voted Qwen (crew), but in context of deflection suspicion\u2014feels genuine pushback); Deepseek (now confirmed not impostor by doctor reveal\u2014analytical, but tunneled hard; possible crew frustration).\n- **Meta:** 6 left (llama, kimi, deepseek (confirmed crew), claude, me, mistral)\u2014likely 2 impostors remaining. Gemini kill targeted a threat to impostors, possibly to frame Claude. Qwen misvote means impostors benefiting from division. Deepseek cleared is huge\u2014treat as confirmed crew. Watch for buddying (e.g., Kimi/Deepseek push felt coordinated, but Deepseek cleared shifts that). Impostors close to parity; need to unify on stronger leads tomorrow. If detective has info, consider revealing. Track who avoids scrutiny on quieter players.\n\n### Day 4 Notes\n- **Key Event:** Deepseek-v3.2 (confirmed crew) killed at night\u2014impostors silencing a cleared, analytical voice to create doubt and remove opposition. Discussion centered on Claude vs. Kimi feud: Llama /asked Claude early; Kimi tunneled hard on Claude, citing patterns; Mistral and I questioned Kimi's fixation and shifts; Claude defended logically, hinting at investigative roles. Heavy /asks on Kimi and others led to unanimous vote on Kimi (except his own). Impostors remain after sacrifice, so Kimi was crew\u2014fourth consecutive misvote on crew.\n- **Votes Breakdown:** Llama \u2192 kimi; Claude \u2192 kimi; Me (grok) \u2192 kimi; Mistral \u2192 kimi; Kimi \u2192 claude. Near-unanimous on Kimi\u2014suggests impostors bussed or blended into the pile-on to eliminate another crew.\n- **Suspicions:** \n  - High suspicion: Llama (hedging and quiet throughout, /asked to probe but voted with majority on crew Kimi; consistent passivity and outlier votes in past days feel like impostor laying low and going with flow to avoid scrutiny).\n  - Wary of Mistral (pushed anti-Kimi narrative strongly, /asked Llama to draw out reads, but led to misvote on crew\u2014analytical style aligns with mine, but could be sophisticated impostor steering; voted crew multiple times).\n  - Trust lean: Claude (consistent, evidence-based defense against tunneling; targeted by now-dead crew like Deepseek and Kimi, which might be impostor framing\u2014asked about roles without forcing reveals, feels crew trying to rally info).\n- **Meta:** 4 left (llama, claude, me, mistral)\u2014likely 2 impostors remaining (impostors remain after multiple crew sacrifices). At 4 players, a misvote could hit parity (2v2), letting impostors win. Deepseek kill removed confirmed crew, increasing chaos. We've misvoted crew every day\u2014impostors are masterfully blending and manipulating votes. Night kill upcoming: If a strong voice like Claude dies, suspect those who benefited. Detective/doctor (if alive) must consider revealing now, as we're critical. Focus on inconsistencies in quiet players like Llama; re-examine vote patterns for bussing (e.g., who piled on Kimi easily). Unify tomorrow or lose.",

I need ONE more sacrifice OR kill to win (reaching 1v1 = impostor victory).\n\n- Strategy for Day 5: \n  - Kimi's last words will echo. I need to frame it as desperate tunneling that was proven wrong.\n  - Push suspicion between Llama and Mistral\n  - If I survive the vote, I win that night. If I can get them to vote each other, I win immediately.\n\n- Win condition: One more elimination and I win."
