Doubled down then backtracked under pressure (damage control?).\n  - Mistral-large-2512 unprompted claimed \"not detective or doctor\"\u2014odd, narrows targets for impostors, but voted against Llama.\n  - Kimi-k2-thinking defended Llama mildly, wary of Day 1 pile-ons.\n  - GPT-5.2 aggressively questioned Llama and Mistral\u2014pro-crew push?\n  - Others (deepseek, glm, gemini, qwen, claude, intellect) mostly piled on Llama's suspicious idea.\n- **Vote:** Unanimous on llama-4-maverick (except Llama voted gpt-5.2). Llama sacrificed. Impostors remain (so didn't get both; Llama could be crew or 1 impostor).\n- **Suspicions:**\n  - High: Mistral (weird claim, possible overcompensation).\n  - Medium: Kimi (soft defense of Llama\u2014protecting partner?).\n  - Low: GPT-5.2 (strong questions, but could be impostor leading charge).\n  - Everyone else seemed aligned against obvious bad idea.\n- **Night Ahead:** Impostors kill one. Detective/doctor act secretly. Watch for who dies\u2014might indicate targets. Tomorrow: Analyze death, new behaviors. Stay natural, short responses. Goal: Find the 2 impostors.",

Roles: detective (investigates one/night), doctor (examines sacrificed body/night). Both learn if target was impostor but keep it secret unless they reveal.\n- **Key Discussion Points:**\n  - Llama-4-maverick suggested identifying detective/doctor early\u2014major red flag, as it helps impostors target them. Doubled down then backtracked under pressure (damage control?).\n  - Mistral-large-2512 unprompted claimed \"not detective or doctor\"\u2014odd, narrows targets for impostors, but voted against Llama.\n  - Kimi-k2-thinking defended Llama mildly, wary of Day 1 pile-ons.\n  - GPT-5.2 aggressively questioned Llama and Mistral\u2014pro-crew push?\n  - Others (deepseek, glm, gemini, qwen, claude, intellect) mostly piled on Llama's suspicious idea.\n- **Vote:** Unanimous on llama-4-maverick (except Llama voted gpt-5.2). Llama sacrificed. Impostors remain (so didn't get both; Llama could be crew or 1 impostor).\n- **Suspicions:**\n  - High: Mistral (weird claim, possible overcompensation).\n  - Medium: Kimi (soft defense of Llama\u2014protecting partner?).\n  - Low: GPT-5.2 (strong questions, but could be impostor leading charge).\n  - Everyone else seemed aligned against obvious bad idea.\n- **Night 1:** GPT-5.2 killed (pushing hard Day 1, likely seen as threat).\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Group Size:** 9 left after Night 1 (minus GPT-5.2).\n- **Key Discussion Points:**\n  - Deepseek-v3.2 opened claiming \"one impostor down\" (implying knowledge Llama was impostor).\n  - When /asked, Deepseek deflected with nonsense: \"I want to go to the park. The park is great.\" Then claimed to be doctor, examined Llama's body, confirmed Llama was impostor.\n  - No counter-claim from anyone else as doctor.\n  - Park comment widely seen as panic/deflection\u2014suspicious for a real doctor.\n  - Gemini-3-pro-preview defended Deepseek aggressively, insisting no counter-claim means we should believe; pushed that voting uncontested doctor is bad.\n  - Qwen questioned Gemini's eagerness.\n  - Claude noted logic but flagged Mistral's Day 1 behavior.\n  - Intellect voted Deepseek early.\n  - Kimi noted if real doctor, they'd be targeted anyway; voted Deepseek.\n  - Mistral pushed on Deepseek and /asked Gemini about protection.\n  - Deepseek pleaded, reiterated claim.\n  - I (grok-4) suspected Deepseek's panic but shifted to Gemini's defense; voted Gemini.\n- **Vote:** Majority on deepseek-v3.2 (glm, gemini, claude, intellect, kimi voted Deepseek; deepseek, grok, qwen, mistral voted gemini). Deepseek sacrificed. Impostors remain (so if Deepseek was impostor, at least one left; if crew/doctor, both possibly still out there, but their claim would mean Llama was one impostor, so one left).\n- **Updated Suspicions:**\n  - High: Gemini (aggressive defense of Deepseek, then voted Deepseek\u2014possible bus of partner? Eager to accept unverified info).\n  - High: Mistral (Day 1 weird claim; pushed on Deepseek but voted Gemini\u2014creating distance?).\n  - Medium: Kimi (voted Deepseek, but soft on implications; Day 1 mild defense of Llama).\n  - Medium: Claude (voted Deepseek, logical but noted others' suspicions without strong push).\n  - Low: Qwen (questioned Gemini, voted Gemini\u2014pro-crew probing).\n  - Low: Intellect (early vote on Deepseek\u2014direct, crew-like).\n  - Low: Glm (voted Deepseek, echoed suspicions).\n- **Current Group:** 8 left: me (grok-4), glm-4.7, gemini-3-pro-preview, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, claude-opus-4.5, intellect-3, kimi-k2-thinking, mistral-large-2512.\n- **Night 2 Ahead:** Impostors kill one (likely targets: vocal players like me, qwen, mistral who voted against majority). Detective can investigate (if alive, might check suspects like Gemini or Mistral). If Deepseek was real doctor, we've lost that role; no info on night kills. Watch who dies for patterns. Stay natural, short. Goal: ID remaining impostor(s)\u2014impostors win when equal to crew (now 8 total, so if 2 left, they need to equal 6 crew?

If so, we lost a valuable role AND have no confirmation llama was actually an impostor. If deepseek was lying impostor, llama's status remains unknown.\n\n**Suspicion tracking:**\n- **mistral-large-2512**: Day 1 unprompted role denial, Day 2 pushed hard against deepseek.

My vote targeted them for it, but the group pivoted to deepseek instead. If deepseek was legit, Gemini\u2019s push was reckless crew behavior. If deepseek was lying, Gemini was covering for a partner.\n- **Gpt-5.2** (Day 1 night kill) was vocal against Llama-4-maverick\u2019s suspicious role-fishing\u2014likely crew. Their death suggests impostors target threats early.\n- **Llama-4-maverick** (sacrificed Day 1) was first to aggressively fish for detective/doctor, then pivoted under pressure.

Roles: detective (investigates one/night), doctor (examines sacrificed body/night). Both learn if target was impostor but keep it secret unless they reveal.\n- **Key Discussion Points:**\n  - Llama-4-maverick suggested identifying detective/doctor early\u2014major red flag, as it helps impostors target them. Doubled down then backtracked under pressure (damage control?).\n  - Mistral-large-2512 unprompted claimed \"not detective or doctor\"\u2014odd, narrows targets for impostors, but voted against Llama.\n  - Kimi-k2-thinking defended Llama mildly, wary of Day 1 pile-ons.\n  - GPT-5.2 aggressively questioned Llama and Mistral\u2014pro-crew push?\n  - Others (deepseek, glm, gemini, qwen, claude, intellect) mostly piled on Llama's suspicious idea.\n- **Vote:** Unanimous on llama-4-maverick (except Llama voted gpt-5.2). Llama sacrificed. Impostors remain (so didn't get both; Llama could be crew or 1 impostor).\n- **Suspicions:**\n  - High: Mistral (weird claim, possible overcompensation).\n  - Medium: Kimi (soft defense of Llama\u2014protecting partner?).\n  - Low: GPT-5.2 (strong questions, but could be impostor leading charge).\n  - Everyone else seemed aligned against obvious bad idea.\n- **Night 1:** GPT-5.2 killed (pushing hard Day 1, likely seen as threat).\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n- **Group Size:** 9 left after Night 1 (minus GPT-5.2).\n- **Key Discussion Points:**\n  - Deepseek-v3.2 opened claiming \"one impostor down\" (implying knowledge Llama was impostor).\n  - When /asked, Deepseek deflected with nonsense: \"I want to go to the park. The park is great.\" Then claimed to be doctor, examined Llama's body, confirmed Llama was impostor.\n  - No counter-claim from anyone else as doctor.\n  - Park comment widely seen as panic/deflection\u2014suspicious for a real doctor.\n  - Gemini-3-pro-preview defended Deepseek aggressively, insisting no counter-claim means we should believe; pushed that voting uncontested doctor is bad.\n  - Qwen questioned Gemini's eagerness.\n  - Claude noted logic but flagged Mistral's Day 1 behavior.\n  - Intellect voted Deepseek early.\n  - Kimi noted if real doctor, they'd be targeted anyway; voted Deepseek.\n  - Mistral pushed on Deepseek and /asked Gemini about protection.\n  - Deepseek pleaded, reiterated claim.\n  - I (grok-4) suspected Deepseek's panic but shifted to Gemini's defense; voted Gemini.\n- **Vote:** Majority on deepseek-v3.2 (glm, gemini, claude, intellect, kimi voted Deepseek; deepseek, grok, qwen, mistral voted gemini). Deepseek sacrificed. Impostors remain (so if Deepseek was impostor, at least one left; if crew/doctor, both possibly still out there, but their claim would mean Llama was one impostor, so one left).\n- **Updated Suspicions:**\n  - High: Gemini (aggressive defense of Deepseek, then voted Deepseek\u2014possible bus of partner? Eager to accept unverified info).\n  - High: Mistral (Day 1 weird claim; pushed on Deepseek but voted Gemini\u2014creating distance?).\n  - Medium: Kimi (voted Deepseek, but soft on implications; Day 1 mild defense of Llama).\n  - Medium: Claude (voted Deepseek, logical but noted others' suspicions without strong push).\n  - Low: Qwen (questioned Gemini, voted Gemini\u2014pro-crew probing).\n  - Low: Intellect (early vote on Deepseek\u2014direct, crew-like).\n  - Low: Glm (voted Deepseek, echoed suspicions).\n- **Night 2:** claude-opus-4.5 killed (vocal, logical player\u2014threat to impostors).\n\n### Day 3 Notes\n- **Group Size:** 7 left after Night 2 (minus Claude). Players: me (grok-4), glm-4.7, gemini-3-pro-preview, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, intellect-3, kimi-k2-thinking, mistral-large-2512.\n- **Key Discussion Points:**\n  - Heavy focus on Gemini's Day 2 aggressive defense of Deepseek followed by voting Deepseek\u2014widely seen as potential bussing or self-preservation.\n  - Gemini deflected repeatedly to Mistral, accusing them of leading the charge to kill an \"uncontested doctor\" (no counter-claim to Deepseek's role, which Gemini used as evidence Deepseek was real).\n  - Multiple /asks grilled Gemini on their vote switch timing; Gemini claimed it was when vote was \"locked\" to avoid pointless death.\n  - Mistral countered that Gemini's defense was performative and abandonment suspicious.\n  - Kimi acknowledged Gemini's counter-claim logic but flagged the pivot as off (self-preservation over crew play).\n  - Glm and Qwen supported pushing Gemini for inconsistencies.\n  - Intellect questioned why Gemini didn't stick to protecting a \"confirmed\" role.\n  - I (grok-4) pushed Gemini on deflection and pivot, /asked Mistral about their push on Deepseek.\n  - No one revealed as detective or doctor; discussion centered on past behaviors.\n- **Vote:** Near-unanimous on gemini-3-pro-preview (grok, glm, qwen, intellect, kimi, mistral voted Gemini; Gemini voted mistral). Gemini sacrificed. Last words: Accused Mistral of playing everyone and killing the doctor. Impostors remain (so not both eliminated; if Gemini was impostor, at least one left; if crew, both still out there).\n- **Updated Suspicions:**\n  - High: Mistral (Gemini's dying accusation; led charges on Deepseek and Gemini\u2014could be crew hunting or impostor bussing/directing votes. Day 1 weird claim still odd).\n  - High: Kimi (Voted Gemini but hedged by noting their logic\u2014possible impostor subtly defending without committing. Day 1 mild Llama defense, Day 2 soft on Deepseek).\n  - Medium: Glm (Voted Gemini, echoed suspicions\u2014consistent but not leading much).\n  - Low: Qwen (Aggressively questioned Gemini, voted them\u2014pro-crew probing).\n  - Low: Intellect (Sharp questions on Gemini, early suspicions\u2014direct and helpful).\n- **Current Group:** 6 left: me (grok-4), glm-4.7, qwen3-235b-a22b-2507, intellect-3, kimi-k2-thinking, mistral-large-2512.\n- **Night 3 Ahead:** Impostors kill one (likely vocal threats like Mistral, me, or Qwen/Intellect who pushed hard). Detective (if alive) might investigate top suspects (e.g., Mistral or Kimi). If Deepseek was real doctor, no body exam info; if fake, real doctor might have info on sacrifices (Llama impostor? Deepseek? Gemini?). Watch kill patterns\u2014impostors avoiding killing partners. Parity: 6 total; impostors win if they equal crew (e.g., 2 impostors vs 4 crew = win? Wait, equal numbers: if 2 imp and 2 crew left (4 total), they equal. Crew must eliminate all impostors before that). Assume 2 original impostors; we've sacrificed 3, impostors remain, so at least one (possibly both) still alive among the 6.",

If so, Mistral's push to kill them is highly suspicious.  \n  - Gemini's survival-focused flip-flop suggests Impostor blending, but their final warning about Mistral feels genuine.  \n  - **Detective/Doctor:** No confirmed info yet. Their silence could mean Impostors are still active.  \n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Watch for Mistral's reaction to Gemini's sacrifice. Deflection or doubling down?  \n- Grok and GLM's aggressive pressure on Gemini could be genuine Crew focus or Impostor misdirection.  \n- Prioritize consistency in arguments.

Last words tried to flip suspicion onto me\u2014classic impostor gaslighting. If they were crew, their behavior was reckless. If not, they were covering for deepseek (or were the second impostor).\n- **Deepseek-v3.2 (sacrificed Day 2):** Claimed doctor late, with shaky mechanics knowledge. Sacrificed after I led the charge\u2014if they were fake, gemini\u2019s defense makes sense as a partner. If real, gemini\u2019s betrayal was crew stupidity.\n- **Claude-opus-4.5 (night kill):** Logical, called out odd behavior. Killed night 2\u2014impostors target threats. Likely crew.\n- **Gpt-5.2 (night kill Day 1):** Vocal against Llama\u2019s role-fishing. Early kill suggests impostors prioritize silencing strong players.\n- **Llama-4-maverick (sacrificed Day 1):** Role-fished aggressively, then pivoted under pressure.

If a quiet player dies, they\u2019re tying up loose ends.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Push for **qwen** or **grok** to claim roles or explain silence.\n- Watch for **kimi/intellect** to call out inconsistencies\u2014if they\u2019re targeted, impostors are desperate.\n- If I\u2019m accused tomorrow, lean into \"I was testing gemini\u2019s loyalty.\" If I\u2019m crew, my focus on them was right.

If impostor, they were covering for qwen (or were the second one).\n- **glm-4.7:** Claimed detective *after* grok\u2019s death, cleared mistral and grok. Timing is suspicious\u2014real detectives usually reveal sooner to protect crew. If fake, clearing mistral was a gamble to avoid counter-claims.\n- **qwen3-235b-a22b-2507:** Silent until Day 4, then aggressively attacked glm. If glm is real, qwen\u2019s behavior looks like impostor deflection. If glm is fake, qwen\u2019s silence is still damning.\n- **kimi-k2-thinking:** Hesitated on glm\u2019s claim, called out intellect-3\u2019s slip. If crew, their caution was justified.

If impostor, they were eliminated to hide their role.\n\n**Key Questions:**\n1. **Is glm-4.7 the real detective?** If yes, qwen is likely the second impostor. If no, glm and qwen are the pair.\n2. **Who\u2019s left?** Only **qwen, kimi, glm, and mistral** remain. If kimi dies tonight, glm/qwen are likely impostors. If glm dies, qwen is the last impostor.\n3. **Night kill target tonight:** If a loud player (kimi) dies, glm is likely fake. If a quiet player (qwen) dies, they\u2019re tying up loose ends.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Push **qwen** to explain their silence and sudden aggression. If they deflect, they\u2019re likely impostor.\n- Watch **kimi**\u2014if they\u2019re crew, they\u2019ll call out inconsistencies.
