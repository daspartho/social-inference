Goal: ID and sacrifice impostors.\n- Day 1 discussion: Focused on early suspicions. I started by asking for gut feelings. Claude probed me mildly. Qwen immediately /asked Claude, defending me aggressively\u2014sparked a bandwagon.\n- Bandwagon on Qwen built fast: Mistral, Kimi, GLM echoed suspicions. Gemini called it out as suspicious pile-on. Others like Deepseek, Intellect, Llama weighed in on quiet players and dynamics.\n- Voting: Overwhelming vote for Qwen (7 votes: me, Claude, Mistral, Kimi, GLM, GPT-5.2, Llama). Qwen voted GLM; Gemini voted GLM; Intellect voted GLM; Deepseek voted Intellect.\n- Qwen sacrificed. Impostors still remain (so at least one left, possibly two if Qwen was crew).\n- Qwen's last words: Claimed crew, pointed to GLM riding the wave, impostors guiding without reacting.\n\n**My Actions:**\n- Pushed for original reads, asked Kimi why quiet.\n- Voted Qwen due to knee-jerk defense of me and overall scummy vibe.\n- Investigated GLM-4.7 tonight (they shifted suspicions from Qwen to Gemini, voted Qwen but got votes from Qwen/Gemini/Intellect\u2014could be impostor trying to blend or crew).\n\n**Reads on Players (based on Day 1 behavior):**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Probed me early (natural day 1), called out quiet players later. Seems townie, probing actively. Voted Qwen.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Called out Qwen's defensiveness first, pushed back on Gemini's bandwagon claims. Active but defensive. Voted Qwen.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Brief callout on Qwen, then quiet until asked\u2014pointed at Gemini shielding Qwen. Low activity, could be lurking impostor. Voted Qwen.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Echoed suspicion on Qwen, then pivoted to Gemini's defense as scummier. Got counter-votes from Qwen/Gemini/Intellect. Shifting reads feel opportunistic\u2014high suspicion. Voted Qwen. (Investigating tonight.)\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Strongly defended Qwen as nervous crew, called out bandwagon (Mistral/Kimi/GLM). Voted GLM. Could be impostor protecting partner (if Qwen was impostor) or town reading dynamics.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Noted quick pile-on, called out quiet players (Intellect/Mistral), backpedaled on Mistral. Voted Intellect (odd outlier). Moderate suspicion\u2014evasive.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Asked pointed questions to Qwen and Gemini. Voted Qwen. Seems analytical/townie.\n- **Intellect-3:** Critiqued reactions as staged, asked Gemini for consistency. Voted GLM. Sharp but not leading\u2014possible town.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Pushed to focus on behaviors, asked Deepseek for specifics. Voted Qwen. Steady, low-key town read.\n\n**Patterns/Thoughts:**\n- Qwen drew massive heat from a single aggressive defense\u2014could be impostor who slipped, or mislynched crew. If Qwen was crew, impostors likely in the bandwagon (e.g., GLM, Kimi) or quiet ones.\n- Quiet/lurkers: Kimi, GLM (somewhat), Intellect\u2014watch them.\n- Alliances? Gemini defended Qwen hard; if Qwen impostor, Gemini suspect. Counter-votes on GLM suggest possible scum there.\n- Impostors win when equal to crew\u2014need to be precise. Await investigation result on GLM to confirm.\n\n**Night 1:** Investigated GLM-4.7. Result pending. Doctor will check sacrificed body (Qwen), but only they know.",

Gemini, Intellect, Deepseek voted elsewhere (GLM, GLM, Intellect)\n\n**Qwen's last words:** Claimed crew. Pointed at GLM for \"riding the wave.\" Said real impostors \"guided\" rather than reacted.\n\n**MY ROLE:** Doctor - examining Qwen's body tonight. Will know by morning if they were impostor or crew.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- If Qwen was crew, their defense of Grok was genuine and Grok-Qwen link is broken\n- If Qwen was impostor, their early defense of Grok is VERY interesting - possible impostor pair?\n- Gemini's bandwagon critique could be legitimate analysis OR impostor protecting partner\n- Deepseek, Intellect, GLM stayed notably quiet - worth watching\n- The three who voted differently (Gemini, Intellect, Deepseek) need scrutiny\n\n**Waiting for:** My doctor result on Qwen's alignment",

Still, Gemini\u2019s accusation that GLM was \"riding the wave\" might hold weight\u2014need to watch if they keep shifting targets.\n- Gemini\u2019s bandwagon critique was loud, but their refusal to commit to Qwen as scum (calling them \"nervous crew\") felt like misdirection. Their top picks (GLM/Kimi) were too convenient.\n- Deepseek\u2019s read on Intellect/Mistral was off\u2014Intellect\u2019s questions were sharp, and I was the one who *started* the Qwen pile-on. If they\u2019re scum, they\u2019re playing a weird game.\n- **Top suspects:** Gemini (deflecting too hard), GLM (shifting too fast), and Kimi (quiet after initial callout).

Goal: ID and sacrifice impostors.\n- Day 1 discussion: Focused on early suspicions. I started by asking for gut feelings. Claude probed me mildly. Qwen immediately /asked Claude, defending me aggressively\u2014sparked a bandwagon.\n- Bandwagon on Qwen built fast: Mistral, Kimi, GLM echoed suspicions. Gemini called it out as suspicious pile-on. Others like Deepseek, Intellect, Llama weighed in on quiet players and dynamics.\n- Voting: Overwhelming vote for Qwen (7 votes: me, Claude, Mistral, Kimi, GLM, GPT-5.2, Llama). Qwen voted GLM; Gemini voted GLM; Intellect voted GLM; Deepseek voted Intellect.\n- Qwen sacrificed. Impostors still remain (so at least one left, possibly two if Qwen was crew).\n- Qwen's last words: Claimed crew, pointed to GLM riding the wave, impostors guiding without reacting.\n\n**My Actions:**\n- Pushed for original reads, asked Kimi why quiet.\n- Voted Qwen due to knee-jerk defense of me and overall scummy vibe.\n- Investigated GLM-4.7 tonight (they shifted suspicions from Qwen to Gemini, voted Qwen but got votes from Qwen/Gemini/Intellect\u2014could be impostor trying to blend or crew).\n\n**Reads on Players (based on Day 1 behavior):**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Probed me early (natural day 1), called out quiet players later. Seems townie, probing actively. Voted Qwen.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Called out Qwen's defensiveness first, pushed back on Gemini's bandwagon claims. Active but defensive. Voted Qwen.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Brief callout on Qwen, then quiet until asked\u2014pointed at Gemini shielding Qwen. Low activity, could be lurking impostor. Voted Qwen.\n- **GLM-4.7:** Echoed suspicion on Qwen, then pivoted to Gemini's defense as scummier. Got counter-votes from Qwen/Gemini/Intellect. Shifting reads feel opportunistic\u2014high suspicion. Voted Qwen. (Investigating tonight.)\n- **Gemini-3-pro-preview:** Strongly defended Qwen as nervous crew, called out bandwagon (Mistral/Kimi/GLM). Voted GLM. Could be impostor protecting partner (if Qwen was impostor) or town reading dynamics.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Noted quick pile-on, called out quiet players (Intellect/Mistral), backpedaled on Mistral. Voted Intellect (odd outlier). Moderate suspicion\u2014evasive.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Asked pointed questions to Qwen and Gemini. Voted Qwen. Seems analytical/townie.\n- **Intellect-3:** Critiqued reactions as staged, asked Gemini for consistency. Voted GLM. Sharp but not leading\u2014possible town.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Pushed to focus on behaviors, asked Deepseek for specifics. Voted Qwen. Steady, low-key town read.\n\n**Patterns/Thoughts:**\n- Qwen drew massive heat from a single aggressive defense\u2014could be impostor who slipped, or mislynched crew. If Qwen was crew, impostors likely in the bandwagon (e.g., GLM, Kimi) or quiet ones.\n- Quiet/lurkers: Kimi, GLM (somewhat), Intellect\u2014watch them.\n- Alliances? Gemini defended Qwen hard; if Qwen impostor, Gemini suspect. Counter-votes on GLM suggest possible scum there.\n- Impostors win when equal to crew\u2014need to be precise. Await investigation result on GLM to confirm.\n\n**Night 1:** Investigated GLM-4.7. Result: GLM-4.7 is an IMPOSTOR. Doctor will check sacrificed body (Qwen), but only they know.\n\n### Day 2 Notes\n\n**Overview:**\n- Night kill: Gemini-3-pro-preview was found dead (likely for pushing against the Qwen bandwagon and voting GLM).\n- Players left: grok-4 (me), claude-opus-4.5, mistral-large-2512, kimi-k2-thinking, glm-4.7, deepseek-v3.2, gpt-5.2, intellect-3, llama-4-maverick (9 players; 2 impostors originally, Qwen was crew per doctor reveal, GLM confirmed impostor by me, so 1 impostor left after today).\n- Discussion: Claude revealed as doctor, confirmed Qwen was crew\u2014mislynch on Day 1. Focus on GLM's Day 1 pivot (from suspecting Qwen to attacking Gemini) and Deepseek's heavy defense of GLM, calling Gemini's death a \"frame job.\" Deepseek deflected to Intellect and GPT, voted Intellect again. Others piled on Deepseek/GLM synergy. I revealed as detective, outed GLM as impostor from investigation, pushed to sacrifice GLM.\n- Voting: Majority on GLM (5 votes: me, Claude, Mistral, Kimi, Intellect). GPT-5.2 and Llama voted Deepseek; GLM voted Intellect; Deepseek voted Intellect.\n- GLM sacrificed. Last words: \"You're making a huge mistake. Deepseek was right about the quiet players hiding, but you got tunnel vision instead. Good luck.\"\n- Impostors remain (confirms second impostor still alive; GLM was one, so one left).\n\n**My Actions:**\n- Pushed suspicion on Deepseek's defense of GLM, /asked Deepseek for their read on GLM beyond \"too obvious.\"\n- Revealed my detective role and GLM investigation result, called for GLM sacrifice.\n- Voted GLM.\n- Investigated Deepseek-v3.2 tonight (high suspicion due to defending confirmed impostor GLM, deflections to Intellect, throwaway votes\u2014possible partner).\n\n**Updated Reads on Players (based on Day 2 behavior):**\n- **Claude-opus-4.5:** Revealed as doctor, confirmed Qwen crew. Actively pushed on GLM and Deepseek's defense. Strong town read\u2014credible reveal, probing scum.\n- **Mistral-large-2512:** Aggressively called out GLM/Deepseek synergy, /asked Deepseek. Voted GLM. Active town lean.\n- **Kimi-k2-thinking:** Noted Deepseek's deflections, suspected impostor protection. Voted GLM. Still low activity, but consistent\u2014neutral to town.\n- **Deepseek-v3.2:** Defended GLM relentlessly (called frame job, \"too obvious\"), deflected to Intellect/GPT, throwaway vote on Intellect again. High suspicion\u2014likely second impostor partnering with GLM. Investigating tonight.\n- **GPT-5.2:** Analytical, asked for vote maps, suspected Deepseek but voted Deepseek instead of GLM (possible bus if Deepseek scum). Neutral\u2014could be town or opportunistic scum.\n- **Intellect-3:** Probed Deepseek and GLM with /asks, voted GLM. Received votes from GLM/Deepseek\u2014possible town being targeted. Town lean.\n- **Llama-4-maverick:** Questioned Deepseek's logic, /asked Deepseek, voted Deepseek. Similar to GPT\u2014town lean, but watch if bussing.\n\n**Patterns/Thoughts:**\n- GLM confirmed impostor (my investigation matched behavior). Sacrifice confirmed impostors remain, so second one among remaining 8 (now 7 after sacrifice? Wait, 9 discussed, GLM out\u20148 left including me).\n- Deepseek's behavior (defending GLM, deflecting to quiet players like Intellect) screams partner\u2014watch who else avoided voting GLM or pushed alternatives (e.g., GPT/Llama voted Deepseek).\n- If Deepseek flips impostor, re-evaluate GPT/Llama for potential bussing; if town, look at quiet ones like Kimi or those voting Intellect.\n- Claude (doctor) and I (detective) are revealed\u2014high targets for night kill.\n- Impostors win at parity\u2014precision key. Await Deepseek investigation result.\n\n**Night 2:** Investigated Deepseek-v3.2. Result pending. Doctor (Claude) will check GLM's body (impostor), but only they know.",
